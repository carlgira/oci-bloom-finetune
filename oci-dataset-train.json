        "text": "oracle cloud infrastructure, oci, Cloud Shell service, \n Cloud Shell Limitations, \nKeep the following limitations in mind when using Cloud Shell:\n\nCloud Shell comes with 5GB\u00c2\u00a0of storage for the VM's home directory. This storage is persistent from session to session, but after 6-months of non-use, the administrator for your tenancy will receive a notification that the storage will be removed in 60 days. Starting a cloud shell session resets the storage removal timer.\nCloud Shell does not support mounting additional storage.\nCloud Shell does not scan user files for malware or viruses.\nCloud Shell sessions do not allow for any incoming connections, and there is no\n                public IP address available.\nThe OCI CLI will execute commands against the region selected in the Console's Region selection menu when the Cloud Shell was started. Changing the region selection in the console will not change the region for existing Cloud Shell instances; you will need to open a new Cloud Shell instance to change regions.\nCloud Shell sessions have a maximum length of 24 hours, and time out after 60\n                minutes of inactivity.\n\nCloud Shell uses websockets to communicate between your browser and the service.\n                    If your browser has websockets disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has\n                    websockets disabled you will see an error message (\"An unexpected error\n                    occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud Shell from the console.\n\nCloud Shell is designed for interactive use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Users who need additional storage for Cloud Shell or want to run non-interactive long-running tasks are encouraged to use Compute and Storage resources in their tenancy.\nFor maximum compatibility, Cloud Shell includes Python version 2 and Python version\n                3. Python 2 is the default that will run when you enter 'python' at the command\n                line. To run Python 3, enter 'python3' at the command line.\nThe following reserved words can't be used as the user name for a Cloud Shell user: oci, root, bin, daemon, adm, lp, sync, shutdown, halt, mai, operator, games, ftp, nobody, oci, systemd-network, dbus, polkitd, tss, and apache. Attempting to create a Cloud Shell session when logged in with a user name (or the part of the name before the @ sign if the user name is an email address)\u00c2\u00a0that is one of these reserved words will result in an \"Unexpected Error\" message.\nEntirely numerical user names (for example, \"1234\")\u00c2\u00a0are not supported by Cloud Shell.\nThe Cloud Shell session time zone is UTC, and cannot be changed.\nCloud Shell does not allow root access or the use of sudo, so packages that require\n                root access for installation can't be installed. Many packages are available in\n                versions that do not require root for installation; you can unpack and install these\n                in your home directory. \nCloud Shell does not allow the use of ping, since ping requires root access.\nCloud Shell boots in FIPS mode, which might affect the behavior of some commands.\nCloud Shell cannot generate PKCS#1 keys when using the openssl command, because Cloud Shell boots in FIPS mode. FIPS mode requires that Cloud Shell generates PKCS#8 keys.\nFor more information on Cloud Shell limits, see the Cloud Shell section in Service Limits. \n\nCloud Shell Access and Other Restrictions\nYou can access OCI resources from Cloud Shell according to the policies granted by\n                your tenancy administrator. There is no additional access because you're using Cloud\n                Shell, and Cloud Shell does not provide any additional access to your tenancy, or\n                private resources in your tenancy VCNs. Note Cloud Shell uses websockets to\n                    communicate between your browser and the service. If your browser has websockets\n                    disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has websockets disabled you will see an\n                    error message (\"An unexpected error occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud\n                    Shell from the console.\nWhile Cloud Shell provides access to the internet, there is no ingress from the\n                outside world into Cloud Shell (for example: you cannot ssh in to Cloud Shell) and\n                no public IP address available. If your tenancy admin does not want to enable access\n                to the internet from OCI, they should not grant access to Cloud Shell with an IAM\n                policy.\n\n"

Once a developer creates a Data Flow Application, anyone can use\n                        it without worrying about the complexities of deploying it, setting it up,\n                        or running it.\nData Flow Library\nThe Library is the central repository of Data Flow Applications. Anyone can\n                        browse, search, and execute applications published to the Library, subject\n                        to having the correct permissions in the Data Flow system.\nData Flow Runs\nEvery time a Data Flow\n                        Application is run, a Run is created. The Data Flow Run captures the\n                        Application's output, logs, and statistics that are automatically securely\n                        stored. Output is saved so it can be viewed by anyone with the correct\n                        permissions using the UI or REST API. Runs give you secure access to the\n                        Spark UI for debugging and diagnostics.\nElastic Compute\nEvery time you run a Data Flow\n                        Application, you decide how big you want it to be. Data Flow allocates your VMs, runs\n                        your job, securely captures all output, and shuts the cluster down. You\n                        don't have anything to maintain in Data Flow. Clusters only run when\n                        there is real work to do.\nElastic Storage\nData Flow works with the\n                        Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage service. For more information,\n                        see the Overview of Object Storage.\nSecurity\nData Flow is integrated with\n                        Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Identity and Access Management (IAM) for\n                        authentication and authorization. Your Spark applications run on behalf of\n                        the person who launches them. This means that the Spark application has the\n                        same privileges the end user has. You do not need to use credentials to\n                        access any IAM-capable system. In addition, Data Flow benefits from all the other\n                        security attributes of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure including transparent\n                        encryption of data at rest and in motion.\nAdministrator Controls\nData Flow allows you to set\n                        service limits, and create administrators who have full control over all\n                        applications and runs. You are in control regardless of how many users you\n                        have.\nApache Spark\nApache Spark is a unified analytics engine for big data processing,\n                                with built-in modules for streaming, SQL, machine learning and graph\n                                processing.\nSpark Application\nA Spark Application uses the Spark API to perform distributed data\n                        processing tasks. Spark Applications can be written in several languages\n                        including Java, Python and more. Spark Applications manifest themselves as\n                        files such as JAR files that are executed within the Spark framework.\nSpark UI\nThe Spark UI is included with Apache Spark and is an important tool\n                        for debugging and diagnosing Spark applications. You can access the Spark UI\n                        for any Data Flow Run, subject to the\n                        Run\u00e2\u0080\u0099s authorization policies.\nSpark Logs\nSpark generates Spark Log files which are useful for debugging and\n                        diagnostics. Each Data Flow Run\n                        automatically stores log files which you can access via UI or API, subject\n                        to the Run\u00e2\u0080\u0099s authorization policies.\nEnhanced Logs\nDriver and executor logs, both StdOut and StdErr, provided by Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Logging. It is optional whether you use\n                        them.\n\n\n"

Each service in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure integrates with IAM for authentication and authorization, for all interfaces (the Console, SDK or CLI, and REST API).\nTo use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, you must be given the required type of access in a policy written by an administrator in the tenancy's root compartment, whether you're using the Console or the REST API with an SDK, CLI, or other tool. If you try to perform an action and get a message that you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have permission or are unauthorized, confirm with your administrator that you've been granted access.\n Note  Cloud Shell does not support policies at the compartment level, only at the\n                tenancy level.The resource name for Cloud Shell is `cloud-shell`. The\n            following is an example policy to grant access to Cloud Shell:\nallow group <GROUP-NAME> to use cloud-shell in tenancy\n\nThis example policy shows how to allow a group within a domain to use Cloud\n            Shell:allow group <DOMAIN-NAME>/<GROUP-NAME> to use cloud-shell in tenancy\nIf you're new to policies, see Getting Started with Policies and Common Policies.\n"

        "text": "oracle cloud infrastructure, oci, Cloud Shell service, \n Cloud Shell Limitations, \nKeep the following limitations in mind when using Cloud Shell:\n\nCloud Shell comes with 5GB\u00c2\u00a0of storage for the VM's home directory. This storage is persistent from session to session, but after 6-months of non-use, the administrator for your tenancy will receive a notification that the storage will be removed in 60 days. Starting a cloud shell session resets the storage removal timer.\nCloud Shell does not support mounting additional storage.\nCloud Shell does not scan user files for malware or viruses.\nCloud Shell sessions do not allow for any incoming connections, and there is no\n                public IP address available.\nThe OCI CLI will execute commands against the region selected in the Console's Region selection menu when the Cloud Shell was started. Changing the region selection in the console will not change the region for existing Cloud Shell instances; you will need to open a new Cloud Shell instance to change regions.\nCloud Shell sessions have a maximum length of 24 hours, and time out after 60\n                minutes of inactivity.\n\nCloud Shell uses websockets to communicate between your browser and the service.\n                    If your browser has websockets disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has\n                    websockets disabled you will see an error message (\"An unexpected error\n                    occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud Shell from the console.\n\nCloud Shell is designed for interactive use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Users who need additional storage for Cloud Shell or want to run non-interactive long-running tasks are encouraged to use Compute and Storage resources in their tenancy.\nFor maximum compatibility, Cloud Shell includes Python version 2 and Python version\n                3. Python 2 is the default that will run when you enter 'python' at the command\n                line. To run Python 3, enter 'python3' at the command line.\nThe following reserved words can't be used as the user name for a Cloud Shell user: oci, root, bin, daemon, adm, lp, sync, shutdown, halt, mai, operator, games, ftp, nobody, oci, systemd-network, dbus, polkitd, tss, and apache. Attempting to create a Cloud Shell session when logged in with a user name (or the part of the name before the @ sign if the user name is an email address)\u00c2\u00a0that is one of these reserved words will result in an \"Unexpected Error\" message.\nEntirely numerical user names (for example, \"1234\")\u00c2\u00a0are not supported by Cloud Shell.\nThe Cloud Shell session time zone is UTC, and cannot be changed.\nCloud Shell does not allow root access or the use of sudo, so packages that require\n                root access for installation can't be installed. Many packages are available in\n                versions that do not require root for installation; you can unpack and install these\n                in your home directory. \nCloud Shell does not allow the use of ping, since ping requires root access.\nCloud Shell boots in FIPS mode, which might affect the behavior of some commands.\nCloud Shell cannot generate PKCS#1 keys when using the openssl command, because Cloud Shell boots in FIPS mode. FIPS mode requires that Cloud Shell generates PKCS#8 keys.\nFor more information on Cloud Shell limits, see the Cloud Shell section in Service Limits. \n\nCloud Shell Access and Other Restrictions\nYou can access OCI resources from Cloud Shell according to the policies granted by\n                your tenancy administrator. There is no additional access because you're using Cloud\n                Shell, and Cloud Shell does not provide any additional access to your tenancy, or\n                private resources in your tenancy VCNs. Note Cloud Shell uses websockets to\n                    communicate between your browser and the service. If your browser has websockets\n                    disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has websockets disabled you will see an\n                    error message (\"An unexpected error occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud\n                    Shell from the console.\nWhile Cloud Shell provides access to the internet, there is no ingress from the\n                outside world into Cloud Shell (for example: you cannot ssh in to Cloud Shell) and\n                no public IP address available. If your tenancy admin does not want to enable access\n                to the internet from OCI, they should not grant access to Cloud Shell with an IAM\n                policy.\n\n"

Customers pay for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resource usage to run the listing with UCM credits. For details about UCM and other customer billing models, see Billing Models Offered in the Infrastructure and Platform Services (IaaS/PaaS) Billing Guide.\nCan all Oracle customers use all Oracle Cloud marketplace listings?\nOnly Oracle customers utilizing UCM can buy all listing types including paid marketplace listings or images. Paid listings have additional restrictions based on customer location. Location restrictions are defined in Oracle Cloud Marketplace Territory and Export Compliance Policy.\nAre there any other financial limits to customers purchasing marketplace listings?\nYes. Customers, with prepaid UCM (monthly or annual) are limited to 15% of their commitment for paid listings. Free, BYOL and paid listing usage by UCM pay-as-you-go customers may have limits as defined by your service contract or agreement with Oracle or third-party partner, but Marketplace does not enforce any limits.\n"

See https://community.oracle.com/docs/DOC-899169.\nCan SaaS or container-based solutions be published on Oracle Cloud Marketplace?\nThis feature is currently not available. You can't deploy these listings directly in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure from the Oracle Cloud Marketplace. However, you can publish SaaS and container-based solutions as lead-generation listings. Oracle captures the customer details in a form and sends it to you, the Oracle partner, offline so that you can communicate directly with the customer.\nWhen an Oracle Cloud Marketplace customer clicks Get App for your\n            listing in Oracle Cloud Marketplace, then the customer can either download the listing\n            or Oracle collects the customer details and provides it you, the Oracle partner. If you\n            have included an install package in your marketplace listing, then the package\n            automatically installs and deploys the app to the customer's cloud services when the\n            customer clicks Get App. Such listings are also called\n            click-to-deploy listings. If you have not associated an install package with your\n            listing in Oracle Cloud Marketplace, then Oracle collects the customer details and\n            provides it you, the Oracle partner. Such listings are also called lead-generation\n            listings.\nCan lead-generation listings be converted to click-to-deploy listings?\nYes. Oracle partners who have created lead generation listings can convert these listings to click-to-deploy listings at any time by including an install package in your marketplace listing. See Building an Install Package.\nHow do I integrate my application with Oracle Cloud Applications?\nThe procedure to integrate your application depends on the Oracle Cloud Application with which you want to integrate.

        "text": "oracle cloud infrastructure, oci, Overview service, \n Terminology, \nThe following terms are commonly used in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Marketplace.\n\nTerm\nDescription\n\n\nApp Install Package\n\n\nWhen you create a listing for your application, you can add an app install\n                        package. An app install package includes coding instructions to install and\n                        uninstall the app. It can include an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure machine\n                        image that launches a Compute instance, or a Terraform configuration that\n                        launches a stack on Oracle Resource Manager. Providing an app install\n                        package allows customers to quickly set up the required resources and\n                        install and deploy your app.\n\n\n\nArtifact\n\n\nAn artifact is a generic way to represent any machine images or Terraform\n                        templates that you want to make available through your listing. Create an\n                        artifact to upload a Terraform template or point to an Oracle Cloud\n                        Infrastructure custom image. Then add an app install package to associate an\n                        artifact with your listing.\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\nImages are templates of virtual hard drives that contain the operating system\n                        and software that an instance will run. After importing an image to Oracle\n                        Cloud Infrastructure, you create an artifact to point to an image. That\n                        artifact can then be associated with a listing by adding an app install\n                        package to the listing. Using an image in your listing provides customers a\n                        more streamlined way of getting started with your application.\n\n\n\nListing\n\n\nA listing describes your app or service to users browsing Oracle Cloud\n                        Marketplace for cloud products. It allows you to display images, links,\n                        documentation, videos, and so on, to provide information about your\n                        application or service and to market your application or service to\n                        customers. Each listing is reviewed and approved by Oracle before it can be\n                        published.\n\n\n\nSchema\n\n\nWhen launching Marketplace Stacks, customers are prompted to fill in a form\n                        containing the list of variables that are part of the Stack definition. In\n                        order to provide a better user experience to customers, Oracle provides a\n                        schema file that enables you to specify how these variables can be displayed\n                        and used by customers when they launch a stack.\n\n\n\nStack\n\n\nStacks are Terraform configuration files (templates) packaged along with an\n                        input variable schema file. Stacks are used to build the required\n                        infrastructure, including both low-level components such as compute\n                        instances, storage and networking, as well as high-level components such as\n                        DNS entries, application configuration scripts, license keys, etc. Stacks\n                        launched by customers run on Oracle Resource Manager.\n\n\n\nTerraform Configuration\n\nA Terraform configuration is a set of one or more\n                        .tf files written in HashiCorp Configuration\n                        Language (HCL), which specify the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources to\n                        create. Terraform configuration files including resource metadata and other\n                        important information, like data source definitions and variables\n                        declarations.\n\n"

You start by creating a\n                        listing. A listing is the advertisement for your app or service. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\n                    your sales pitch to potential customers. You can add information to your\n                    listing, preview the listing, and then revise it. You can continue to preview\n                    and revise your listing until it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exactly right. Ensure that your listing\n                    complies with the relevant publisher\n                        guidelines\n\n\nSubmit. When you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ready, submit the listing to Oracle for approval. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll review your listing, as well as your app or service.\nWhat can you expect during the review?\n\n\nFor your listing, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll review the content, perhaps ask a question or two, and maybe suggest some changes.\n\n\nFor apps, our review may include a technical architecture review, a security review, and a demonstration of the app.\n\n\nFor services, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need to see some proof of ability. For example, we may ask you to provide names of existing customers who hired you for your training, consulting, or other professional service. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need to verify that you can deliver the service you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re listing on the marketplace.\n\n\nDuring our review, you monitor our progress and respond to our requests or questions. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\n                    send you an email when your listing is approved. If you had opted to autopublish\n                    your listing on approval, then the notification email will contain a link to the\n                    live listing on Oracle Cloud Marketplace or it will contain the vanity URL for\n                    your listing if you had created one.\n\n\nPublish. When submitting your listing for approval, if you had opted to automatically publish your listing on approval, then the listing would be automatically published to Oracle Cloud Marketplace after approval from Oracle. But, if you had opted to manually publish your listing, then, after we approve your listing, you must publish your listing to Oracle Cloud Marketplace. Your listing isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t publicly visible on the marketplace until you click Publish. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it. One click and your listing is immediately posted to the marketplace.\n Note You can choose to autopublish a listing only if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re approved by Oracle to autopublish listings.\n\n\n"

The icon displays on the listing pages for your app or service. The logo and icon are displayed against a solid white background.\nListing banner: Optionally, you can add a banner to your listing. A banner is a graphic image that displays at the top of the details page and spreads across the width of the page.You can use banners to advertise your product, create a mood, wrap your message in a cool graphic, or make an announcement. Banners are one way to generate excitement and get customers interested in your app or service.Note that banners don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t display on mobile devices.\nVideos and screenshots: Uploading videos and screenshots is a great way to enhance your listing. For example, you can use this feature to walk the Oracle Cloud Marketplace user through the app or service you provide.To improve the quality of your walk-through or image collection, be sure to provide meaningful labels and descriptions of your videos and screenshots. In addition, be sure to order them in a manner that conveys the functionality of your app or highlights the goals of your service.Oracle Cloud Marketplace displays thumbnails for your videos and screenshots on the right side of your app or service listing page. Users can click a thumbnail to enlarge the image view in another window and then click to cycle through your set of videos and screenshots.Images don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to be strictly screenshots.

This storage is persistent from session to session, but after 6-months of non-use, the administrator for your tenancy will receive a notification that the storage will be removed in 60 days. Starting a cloud shell session resets the storage removal timer.\nCloud Shell does not support mounting additional storage.\nCloud Shell does not scan user files for malware or viruses.\nCloud Shell sessions do not allow for any incoming connections, and there is no\n                public IP address available.\nThe OCI CLI will execute commands against the region selected in the Console's Region selection menu when the Cloud Shell was started. Changing the region selection in the console will not change the region for existing Cloud Shell instances; you will need to open a new Cloud Shell instance to change regions.\nCloud Shell sessions have a maximum length of 24 hours, and time out after 60\n                minutes of inactivity.\n\nCloud Shell uses websockets to communicate between your browser and the service.\n                    If your browser has websockets disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has\n                    websockets disabled you will see an error message (\"An unexpected error\n                    occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud Shell from the console.\n\nCloud Shell is designed for interactive use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Users who need additional storage for Cloud Shell or want to run non-interactive long-running tasks are encouraged to use Compute and Storage resources in their tenancy.\nFor maximum compatibility, Cloud Shell includes Python version 2 and Python version\n                3. Python 2 is the default that will run when you enter 'python' at the command\n                line. To run Python 3, enter 'python3' at the command line.\nThe following reserved words can't be used as the user name for a Cloud Shell user: oci, root, bin, daemon, adm, lp, sync, shutdown, halt, mai, operator, games, ftp, nobody, oci, systemd-network, dbus, polkitd, tss, and apache. Attempting to create a Cloud Shell session when logged in with a user name (or the part of the name before the @ sign if the user name is an email address)\u00c2\u00a0that is one of these reserved words will result in an \"Unexpected Error\" message.\nEntirely numerical user names (for example, \"1234\")\u00c2\u00a0are not supported by Cloud Shell.\nThe Cloud Shell session time zone is UTC, and cannot be changed.\nCloud Shell does not allow root access or the use of sudo, so packages that require\n                root access for installation can't be installed. Many packages are available in\n                versions that do not require root for installation; you can unpack and install these\n                in your home directory. \nCloud Shell does not allow the use of ping, since ping requires root access.\nCloud Shell boots in FIPS mode, which might affect the behavior of some commands.\nCloud Shell cannot generate PKCS#1 keys when using the openssl command, because Cloud Shell boots in FIPS mode. FIPS mode requires that Cloud Shell generates PKCS#8 keys.\nFor more information on Cloud Shell limits, see the Cloud Shell section in Service Limits. \n\nCloud Shell Access and Other Restrictions\nYou can access OCI resources from Cloud Shell according to the policies granted by\n                your tenancy administrator. There is no additional access because you're using Cloud\n                Shell, and Cloud Shell does not provide any additional access to your tenancy, or\n                private resources in your tenancy VCNs.

This storage is persistent from session to session, but after 6-months of non-use, the administrator for your tenancy will receive a notification that the storage will be removed in 60 days. Starting a cloud shell session resets the storage removal timer.\nCloud Shell does not support mounting additional storage.\nCloud Shell does not scan user files for malware or viruses.\nCloud Shell sessions do not allow for any incoming connections, and there is no\n                public IP address available.\nThe OCI CLI will execute commands against the region selected in the Console's Region selection menu when the Cloud Shell was started. Changing the region selection in the console will not change the region for existing Cloud Shell instances; you will need to open a new Cloud Shell instance to change regions.\nCloud Shell sessions have a maximum length of 24 hours, and time out after 60\n                minutes of inactivity.\n\nCloud Shell uses websockets to communicate between your browser and the service.\n                    If your browser has websockets disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has\n                    websockets disabled you will see an error message (\"An unexpected error\n                    occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud Shell from the console.\n\nCloud Shell is designed for interactive use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Users who need additional storage for Cloud Shell or want to run non-interactive long-running tasks are encouraged to use Compute and Storage resources in their tenancy.\nFor maximum compatibility, Cloud Shell includes Python version 2 and Python version\n                3. Python 2 is the default that will run when you enter 'python' at the command\n                line. To run Python 3, enter 'python3' at the command line.\nThe following reserved words can't be used as the user name for a Cloud Shell user: oci, root, bin, daemon, adm, lp, sync, shutdown, halt, mai, operator, games, ftp, nobody, oci, systemd-network, dbus, polkitd, tss, and apache. Attempting to create a Cloud Shell session when logged in with a user name (or the part of the name before the @ sign if the user name is an email address)\u00c2\u00a0that is one of these reserved words will result in an \"Unexpected Error\" message.\nEntirely numerical user names (for example, \"1234\")\u00c2\u00a0are not supported by Cloud Shell.\nThe Cloud Shell session time zone is UTC, and cannot be changed.\nCloud Shell does not allow root access or the use of sudo, so packages that require\n                root access for installation can't be installed. Many packages are available in\n                versions that do not require root for installation; you can unpack and install these\n                in your home directory. \nCloud Shell does not allow the use of ping, since ping requires root access.\nCloud Shell boots in FIPS mode, which might affect the behavior of some commands.\nCloud Shell cannot generate PKCS#1 keys when using the openssl command, because Cloud Shell boots in FIPS mode.

For more information, see the Internet Gateway documentation.\nRequirements and IAM Policy\nTo use Private Networking, you (or an administrator) will need to specify the\n                following policies:\n\n\nallow group <group> to use subnets in compartment <compartment>\n\n\nallow group <group> to use vnics in compartment <compartment>\n\n\nallow group <group> to use network-security-groups in compartment <compartment>\n\n\nallow group <group> to inspect vcns in compartment <compartment>\n\n\nIf you're new to policies, see Getting Started with Policies and Common Policies.\nYou'll also need to create private VCNs and Subnets in the appropriate compartments.\n                For more information, see VCNs and Subnets in\n                the Networking\n                documentation. \n\nGetting Started with Private NetworkingTo\n            change which network your Cloud Shell session is using, use the drop-down Network\n            menu at the top of the Cloud Shell terminal window:From this menu you can select a favorite private network connection.\n                To see more options, you can select the Private Network Definition List item,\n                which will display the Private Network Definition List panel. This\n                panel allows you to select additional private networks, and also designate favorite\n                private networks for quick selection (you can have up to 5 favorites):\nCreate a new private network definitionYou can create a\n                new private network definition by clicking the Create private network\n                    definition button. This will bring up the Create Private Network\n                    Definition panel.  Note To create a temporary\n                    ephemeral network, select Ephemeral Private Network Setup from the\n                    network selection drop-down. This is temporary network is only valid for the\n                    length of your Cloud Shell session, and will not be persisted to your list of\n                    defined private networks.Enter a name for your private network\n                definition in the Name text box. Select the VCN and the Subnet to use from the drop-down list boxes. You can also\n                optionally select one or more Network Security groups to use.  Note Only VCNs and Subnets in your home region are available.\n                    If you need to access a subnet in a region that is not your home region, you can\n                    use peering from the subnet used by Private Networking to reach it. For more\n                    information, see VCN Cross-Region Peering.  Note A subnet chosen for a Cloudshell Private Network\n                            must have at least one non-reserved IP address for the subnet's CIDR\n                            block available. If all non-reserved IP addresses have been allocated,\n                            Cloudshell cannot attach to that subnet.For example: If you want to set this definition as the active network,\n                enable the Use as network checkbox.Click the Create button to\n                create your Cloud Shell private network definition.Your Cloud Shell session\n                is now connected to your private network, as indicated in the Networking\n                drop-down at the top of the Cloud Shell terminal session:You can see details about your private network connection by clicking\n                the Details link:\n"

The module then stores them in the\n                        inventory service.\nThe inventory module is used to store information about virtual machines discovered in the on-premises environment that can be migrated. These machines are added to inventory by using API and importing the CSV file, or by running automated discovery in the external environment.\nAssessment and Planning\nOracle Cloud Migrations provides ongoing inventory analysis that contains statistics, summaries, and histograms about the virtual machines in your inventory.\nA virtual machine contains metadata and metrics along with their history and\n                        how they are discovered or imported. Metadata history is tracked so that you\n                        can monitor a virtual machine's evolution over the course of their\n                        long-running migration. Hence, Oracle Cloud Migrations can highlight any changes\n                        that might require revisiting the migration plan.\nA migration project is created that contains the migration plans for replicating the virtual machines.\nA migration plan can group interrelated and dependent virtual machines that\n                        can be migrated together.\nReplication\nVMware virtual machines reference a replication policy that describes how\n                        the machines are migrated into OCI. \nReplication plugin manages the replication of external assets snapshots. Oracle Cloud Migrations determines and manages\n                        full-image or incremental virtual-machine snapshots. For information about\n                        replication, see Understanding VM Replication.\nExecution\nWithin a project, you create migration plans. A migration plan is a mapping of VMware virtual machines to target resource types in OCI. A migration plan provides the context to launch virtual machines, including compartment, subnets, and launch dependencies.\nThe virtual machines are replicated on OCI instances. \nYou can mark the project as complete. After a project is marked complete, Oracle Cloud Migrations decouples the production environment from the migration workflow and archives migrated inventory.\nUsing Oracle Cloud Migrations, you can accelerate your journey to Oracle Cloud by automating the asset discovery, migration planning, and replication processes through the Oracle Cloud Console, REST API, and CLI.

After the agent appliance is registered with a source environment, the agent\n      maintains a persistent secure connection back to OCI by performing a secure token exchange.\n      These secure tokens are refreshed regularly. If the remote agent appliance is unable to refresh the authentication token,\n      the agent is disconnected, and you must manually re-register from the remote agent appliance console.\nEach remote agent appliance can only be registered to one source environment. If virtual machines in an external environment are migrated to multiple OCI regions, do the following: \nCreate a separate source environment for each region.\nDeploy at least one remote agent appliance for each target region. \n\nAfter the remote agent appliance is registered and becomes active, the appliance launches two plugins namely, discovery and replication. The discovery plugin searches for VMware virtual machines in the source environment using environment-specific connectors. The replication plugin manages the replication of source assets snapshots from the source environment to OCI.\nYou can deploy multiple remote agent appliances for a single source\n      environment to provide redundancy and increased replication throughput.\nYou can manage the remote agent appliance in OCI by performing the following tasks:\nRenaming a Remote Agent Appliance\nChecking the Status of a Remote Agent Appliance\nDeleting a Remote Agent Appliance\n\n"

To know\n        about how to create compartments and manage cloud resources in the compartment, see Managing Compartments. \nConsider that migration is a temporary activity in your tenancy. We recommend using a\n        multiple-compartment approach for organizing and managing communication between migration\n        service components. You can create the following three compartments:\n\nMigration: A designated compartment for all the temporary resources that are used\n          when performing migrations. These are source environment, remote connection agents, asset\n          sources, inventory assets, migration projects, migration plans, hydration agents,\n          replicated snapshots, temporary volumes (boot and data volumes.)\nMigration_secrets: A compartment to store secrets that are used by the asset\n          source. For security reasons, we recommend not to share this compartment with any other\n          migration projects, and not to store any other secrets in this compartment. As a best\n          practice, create such compartment for one migration project only, store only essential\n          secrets, and remove the compartment immediately after the migration project\n          completes.\nDestination: A compartment in which the target assets are created. The migrated\n          instances created by Oracle Cloud Migrations reside in this\n          compartment. Use this compartment to be part of post-migration production. Note The\n            destination compartment can be an existing compartment that already has\n            non-migration-related production resources.\n\n\n"

Therefore, you can add the agent dependencies to the\n                    source environment as third-party library dependency to the remote agent\n                    appliance.

To know\n        about how to create compartments and manage cloud resources in the compartment, see Managing Compartments. \nConsider that migration is a temporary activity in your tenancy. We recommend using a\n        multiple-compartment approach for organizing and managing communication between migration\n        service components. You can create the following three compartments:\n\nMigration: A designated compartment for all the temporary resources that are used\n          when performing migrations. These are source environment, remote connection agents, asset\n          sources, inventory assets, migration projects, migration plans, hydration agents,\n          replicated snapshots, temporary volumes (boot and data volumes.)\nMigration_secrets: A compartment to store secrets that are used by the asset\n          source. For security reasons, we recommend not to share this compartment with any other\n          migration projects, and not to store any other secrets in this compartment. As a best\n          practice, create such compartment for one migration project only, store only essential\n          secrets, and remove the compartment immediately after the migration project\n          completes.\nDestination: A compartment in which the target assets are created. The migrated\n          instances created by Oracle Cloud Migrations reside in this\n          compartment. Use this compartment to be part of post-migration production. Note The\n            destination compartment can be an existing compartment that already has\n            non-migration-related production resources.\n\n\n"

        "text": "oracle cloud infrastructure, oci, Cloud Shell service, \n Cloud Shell Limitations, \nKeep the following limitations in mind when using Cloud Shell:\n\nCloud Shell comes with 5GB\u00c2\u00a0of storage for the VM's home directory. This storage is persistent from session to session, but after 6-months of non-use, the administrator for your tenancy will receive a notification that the storage will be removed in 60 days. Starting a cloud shell session resets the storage removal timer.\nCloud Shell does not support mounting additional storage.\nCloud Shell does not scan user files for malware or viruses.\nCloud Shell sessions do not allow for any incoming connections, and there is no\n                public IP address available.\nThe OCI CLI will execute commands against the region selected in the Console's Region selection menu when the Cloud Shell was started. Changing the region selection in the console will not change the region for existing Cloud Shell instances; you will need to open a new Cloud Shell instance to change regions.\nCloud Shell sessions have a maximum length of 24 hours, and time out after 60\n                minutes of inactivity.\n\nCloud Shell uses websockets to communicate between your browser and the service.\n                    If your browser has websockets disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has\n                    websockets disabled you will see an error message (\"An unexpected error\n                    occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud Shell from the console.\n\nCloud Shell is designed for interactive use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Users who need additional storage for Cloud Shell or want to run non-interactive long-running tasks are encouraged to use Compute and Storage resources in their tenancy.\nFor maximum compatibility, Cloud Shell includes Python version 2 and Python version\n                3. Python 2 is the default that will run when you enter 'python' at the command\n                line. To run Python 3, enter 'python3' at the command line.\nThe following reserved words can't be used as the user name for a Cloud Shell user: oci, root, bin, daemon, adm, lp, sync, shutdown, halt, mai, operator, games, ftp, nobody, oci, systemd-network, dbus, polkitd, tss, and apache. Attempting to create a Cloud Shell session when logged in with a user name (or the part of the name before the @ sign if the user name is an email address)\u00c2\u00a0that is one of these reserved words will result in an \"Unexpected Error\" message.\nEntirely numerical user names (for example, \"1234\")\u00c2\u00a0are not supported by Cloud Shell.\nThe Cloud Shell session time zone is UTC, and cannot be changed.\nCloud Shell does not allow root access or the use of sudo, so packages that require\n                root access for installation can't be installed. Many packages are available in\n                versions that do not require root for installation; you can unpack and install these\n                in your home directory. \nCloud Shell does not allow the use of ping, since ping requires root access.\nCloud Shell boots in FIPS mode, which might affect the behavior of some commands.\nCloud Shell cannot generate PKCS#1 keys when using the openssl command, because Cloud Shell boots in FIPS mode. FIPS mode requires that Cloud Shell generates PKCS#8 keys.\nFor more information on Cloud Shell limits, see the Cloud Shell section in Service Limits. \n\nCloud Shell Access and Other Restrictions\nYou can access OCI resources from Cloud Shell according to the policies granted by\n                your tenancy administrator. There is no additional access because you're using Cloud\n                Shell, and Cloud Shell does not provide any additional access to your tenancy, or\n                private resources in your tenancy VCNs. Note Cloud Shell uses websockets to\n                    communicate between your browser and the service. If your browser has websockets\n                    disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has websockets disabled you will see an\n                    error message (\"An unexpected error occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud\n                    Shell from the console.\nWhile Cloud Shell provides access to the internet, there is no ingress from the\n                outside world into Cloud Shell (for example: you cannot ssh in to Cloud Shell) and\n                no public IP address available. If your tenancy admin does not want to enable access\n                to the internet from OCI, they should not grant access to Cloud Shell with an IAM\n                policy.\n\n"

Your Cloud Shell includes a VM provisioned for you that executes in its own tenancy (so it doesn't use any of your tenancy's resources)\u00c2\u00a0and hosts your shell in an Oracle Linux OS while you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re actively using Cloud Shell. \n"

Each service in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure integrates with IAM for authentication and authorization, for all interfaces (the Console, SDK or CLI, and REST API).\nTo use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, you must be given the required type of access in a policy written by an administrator in the tenancy's root compartment, whether you're using the Console or the REST API with an SDK, CLI, or other tool. If you try to perform an action and get a message that you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have permission or are unauthorized, confirm with your administrator that you've been granted access.\n Note  Cloud Shell does not support policies at the compartment level, only at the\n                tenancy level.The resource name for Cloud Shell is `cloud-shell`.

        "text": "oracle cloud infrastructure, oci, Cloud Shell service, \n Cloud Shell Limitations, \nKeep the following limitations in mind when using Cloud Shell:\n\nCloud Shell comes with 5GB\u00c2\u00a0of storage for the VM's home directory. This storage is persistent from session to session, but after 6-months of non-use, the administrator for your tenancy will receive a notification that the storage will be removed in 60 days. Starting a cloud shell session resets the storage removal timer.\nCloud Shell does not support mounting additional storage.\nCloud Shell does not scan user files for malware or viruses.\nCloud Shell sessions do not allow for any incoming connections, and there is no\n                public IP address available.\nThe OCI CLI will execute commands against the region selected in the Console's Region selection menu when the Cloud Shell was started. Changing the region selection in the console will not change the region for existing Cloud Shell instances; you will need to open a new Cloud Shell instance to change regions.\nCloud Shell sessions have a maximum length of 24 hours, and time out after 60\n                minutes of inactivity.\n\nCloud Shell uses websockets to communicate between your browser and the service.\n                    If your browser has websockets disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has\n                    websockets disabled you will see an error message (\"An unexpected error\n                    occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud Shell from the console.\n\nCloud Shell is designed for interactive use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Users who need additional storage for Cloud Shell or want to run non-interactive long-running tasks are encouraged to use Compute and Storage resources in their tenancy.\nFor maximum compatibility, Cloud Shell includes Python version 2 and Python version\n                3. Python 2 is the default that will run when you enter 'python' at the command\n                line. To run Python 3, enter 'python3' at the command line.\nThe following reserved words can't be used as the user name for a Cloud Shell user: oci, root, bin, daemon, adm, lp, sync, shutdown, halt, mai, operator, games, ftp, nobody, oci, systemd-network, dbus, polkitd, tss, and apache. Attempting to create a Cloud Shell session when logged in with a user name (or the part of the name before the @ sign if the user name is an email address)\u00c2\u00a0that is one of these reserved words will result in an \"Unexpected Error\" message.\nEntirely numerical user names (for example, \"1234\")\u00c2\u00a0are not supported by Cloud Shell.\nThe Cloud Shell session time zone is UTC, and cannot be changed.\nCloud Shell does not allow root access or the use of sudo, so packages that require\n                root access for installation can't be installed. Many packages are available in\n                versions that do not require root for installation; you can unpack and install these\n                in your home directory. \nCloud Shell does not allow the use of ping, since ping requires root access.\nCloud Shell boots in FIPS mode, which might affect the behavior of some commands.\nCloud Shell cannot generate PKCS#1 keys when using the openssl command, because Cloud Shell boots in FIPS mode. FIPS mode requires that Cloud Shell generates PKCS#8 keys.\nFor more information on Cloud Shell limits, see the Cloud Shell section in Service Limits. \n\nCloud Shell Access and Other Restrictions\nYou can access OCI resources from Cloud Shell according to the policies granted by\n                your tenancy administrator. There is no additional access because you're using Cloud\n                Shell, and Cloud Shell does not provide any additional access to your tenancy, or\n                private resources in your tenancy VCNs. Note Cloud Shell uses websockets to\n                    communicate between your browser and the service. If your browser has websockets\n                    disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has websockets disabled you will see an\n                    error message (\"An unexpected error occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud\n                    Shell from the console.\nWhile Cloud Shell provides access to the internet, there is no ingress from the\n                outside world into Cloud Shell (for example: you cannot ssh in to Cloud Shell) and\n                no public IP address available. If your tenancy admin does not want to enable access\n                to the internet from OCI, they should not grant access to Cloud Shell with an IAM\n                policy.\n\n"

If you have multiple\n            accounts in a tenancy (for example, you have a federated and a non-federated user\n            account), you will get a separate, unique Cloud Shell home directory for each account. \nChanging the Console region selection, or logging in to the Console via a different\n            regional URL will have no effect on where your Cloud Shell machine and home directory\n            volume are located.

The services can be used independently or together and operate on the content stored in the OCI Object Store.\nOCI Media Flow enables you to configure content processing workflows that can be used to process video source content. The processing includes transcoding, transcribing, thumbnail generation, ABR packaging, and integration with OCI\nAI Services such as Speech (for automatic transcription), Language (for Natural Language Processing (NLP) based analysis of the transcript), and Vision (for object detection and text extraction). \nMedia Flow uses the Object Storage bucket in the OCI\nObject Storage service as the input source and performs the specified transcoding operations to create the ABR package in your object storage bucket. You can deliver the output from OCI Media Flow as streamed Video on Demand (VOD) using OCI Media Streams.\nHere is an overview of a typical end-to-end VOD streaming solution built on OCI. The following diagram shows how OCI Media Flow and OCI Media Streams are integrated. \nKey Capabilities\nUse OCI Media Flow to transcode video into various output formats that are suitable for streaming videos on-demand for multiple device types and resolutions.

This storage is persistent from session to session, but after 6-months of non-use, the administrator for your tenancy will receive a notification that the storage will be removed in 60 days. Starting a cloud shell session resets the storage removal timer.\nCloud Shell does not support mounting additional storage.\nCloud Shell does not scan user files for malware or viruses.\nCloud Shell sessions do not allow for any incoming connections, and there is no\n                public IP address available.\nThe OCI CLI will execute commands against the region selected in the Console's Region selection menu when the Cloud Shell was started. Changing the region selection in the console will not change the region for existing Cloud Shell instances; you will need to open a new Cloud Shell instance to change regions.\nCloud Shell sessions have a maximum length of 24 hours, and time out after 60\n                minutes of inactivity.\n\nCloud Shell uses websockets to communicate between your browser and the service.\n                    If your browser has websockets disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has\n                    websockets disabled you will see an error message (\"An unexpected error\n                    occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud Shell from the console.\n\nCloud Shell is designed for interactive use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Users who need additional storage for Cloud Shell or want to run non-interactive long-running tasks are encouraged to use Compute and Storage resources in their tenancy.\nFor maximum compatibility, Cloud Shell includes Python version 2 and Python version\n                3. Python 2 is the default that will run when you enter 'python' at the command\n                line. To run Python 3, enter 'python3' at the command line.\nThe following reserved words can't be used as the user name for a Cloud Shell user: oci, root, bin, daemon, adm, lp, sync, shutdown, halt, mai, operator, games, ftp, nobody, oci, systemd-network, dbus, polkitd, tss, and apache. Attempting to create a Cloud Shell session when logged in with a user name (or the part of the name before the @ sign if the user name is an email address)\u00c2\u00a0that is one of these reserved words will result in an \"Unexpected Error\" message.\nEntirely numerical user names (for example, \"1234\")\u00c2\u00a0are not supported by Cloud Shell.\nThe Cloud Shell session time zone is UTC, and cannot be changed.\nCloud Shell does not allow root access or the use of sudo, so packages that require\n                root access for installation can't be installed. Many packages are available in\n                versions that do not require root for installation; you can unpack and install these\n                in your home directory. \nCloud Shell does not allow the use of ping, since ping requires root access.\nCloud Shell boots in FIPS mode, which might affect the behavior of some commands.\nCloud Shell cannot generate PKCS#1 keys when using the openssl command, because Cloud Shell boots in FIPS mode. FIPS mode requires that Cloud Shell generates PKCS#8 keys.\nFor more information on Cloud Shell limits, see the Cloud Shell section in Service Limits. \n\nCloud Shell Access and Other Restrictions\nYou can access OCI resources from Cloud Shell according to the policies granted by\n                your tenancy administrator. There is no additional access because you're using Cloud\n                Shell, and Cloud Shell does not provide any additional access to your tenancy, or\n                private resources in your tenancy VCNs. Note Cloud Shell uses websockets to\n                    communicate between your browser and the service. If your browser has websockets\n                    disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has websockets disabled you will see an\n                    error message (\"An unexpected error occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud\n                    Shell from the console.\nWhile Cloud Shell provides access to the internet, there is no ingress from the\n                outside world into Cloud Shell (for example: you cannot ssh in to Cloud Shell) and\n                no public IP address available.

        "text": "oracle cloud infrastructure, oci, Cloud Shell service, \n Cloud Shell Limitations, \nKeep the following limitations in mind when using Cloud Shell:\n\nCloud Shell comes with 5GB\u00c2\u00a0of storage for the VM's home directory. This storage is persistent from session to session, but after 6-months of non-use, the administrator for your tenancy will receive a notification that the storage will be removed in 60 days. Starting a cloud shell session resets the storage removal timer.\nCloud Shell does not support mounting additional storage.\nCloud Shell does not scan user files for malware or viruses.\nCloud Shell sessions do not allow for any incoming connections, and there is no\n                public IP address available.\nThe OCI CLI will execute commands against the region selected in the Console's Region selection menu when the Cloud Shell was started. Changing the region selection in the console will not change the region for existing Cloud Shell instances; you will need to open a new Cloud Shell instance to change regions.\nCloud Shell sessions have a maximum length of 24 hours, and time out after 60\n                minutes of inactivity.\n\nCloud Shell uses websockets to communicate between your browser and the service.\n                    If your browser has websockets disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has\n                    websockets disabled you will see an error message (\"An unexpected error\n                    occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud Shell from the console.\n\nCloud Shell is designed for interactive use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Users who need additional storage for Cloud Shell or want to run non-interactive long-running tasks are encouraged to use Compute and Storage resources in their tenancy.\nFor maximum compatibility, Cloud Shell includes Python version 2 and Python version\n                3. Python 2 is the default that will run when you enter 'python' at the command\n                line. To run Python 3, enter 'python3' at the command line.\nThe following reserved words can't be used as the user name for a Cloud Shell user: oci, root, bin, daemon, adm, lp, sync, shutdown, halt, mai, operator, games, ftp, nobody, oci, systemd-network, dbus, polkitd, tss, and apache. Attempting to create a Cloud Shell session when logged in with a user name (or the part of the name before the @ sign if the user name is an email address)\u00c2\u00a0that is one of these reserved words will result in an \"Unexpected Error\" message.\nEntirely numerical user names (for example, \"1234\")\u00c2\u00a0are not supported by Cloud Shell.\nThe Cloud Shell session time zone is UTC, and cannot be changed.\nCloud Shell does not allow root access or the use of sudo, so packages that require\n                root access for installation can't be installed. Many packages are available in\n                versions that do not require root for installation; you can unpack and install these\n                in your home directory. \nCloud Shell does not allow the use of ping, since ping requires root access.\nCloud Shell boots in FIPS mode, which might affect the behavior of some commands.\nCloud Shell cannot generate PKCS#1 keys when using the openssl command, because Cloud Shell boots in FIPS mode. FIPS mode requires that Cloud Shell generates PKCS#8 keys.\nFor more information on Cloud Shell limits, see the Cloud Shell section in Service Limits. \n\nCloud Shell Access and Other Restrictions\nYou can access OCI resources from Cloud Shell according to the policies granted by\n                your tenancy administrator. There is no additional access because you're using Cloud\n                Shell, and Cloud Shell does not provide any additional access to your tenancy, or\n                private resources in your tenancy VCNs. Note Cloud Shell uses websockets to\n                    communicate between your browser and the service. If your browser has websockets\n                    disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has websockets disabled you will see an\n                    error message (\"An unexpected error occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud\n                    Shell from the console.\nWhile Cloud Shell provides access to the internet, there is no ingress from the\n                outside world into Cloud Shell (for example: you cannot ssh in to Cloud Shell) and\n                no public IP address available. If your tenancy admin does not want to enable access\n                to the internet from OCI, they should not grant access to Cloud Shell with an IAM\n                policy.\n\n"

It provides scalable distribution and origination for just-in-time packaged Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) video content. The OCI\nMedia Services includes OCI Media Flow and OCI Media Streams. The services can be used independently or together and operate on the content stored in the OCI Object Store.\nOCI Media Streams provides the capability to deliver digital video packaged in a format such as HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) to viewers. You can ingest pre-packaged HLS packages or you can use OCI Media Flow to transcode and package a source video into a format suitable for streaming. Media Streams can be configured to act as the origin service for video distribution through a Content Delivery Network (CDN).\nHere is an overview of a typical end-to-end Video on Demand (VOD) streaming solution built on OCI. The following diagram shows how OCI Media Flow and OCI Media Streams are integrated. \nKey Capabilities\nMedia Services includes packaging features for target format conversion, encryption, and video segmentation for ABR streams. It also provides secure and scalable distribution of the packaged ABR content using leading Content Delivery Network (CDN) partner origination integrations or direct serve edge services. Media Streams simplifies the process for distribution and packaging of streaming formats from source content and enables seamless management of complex video packaging infrastructure.\nMedia Streams works by ingestion of HLS (m3u8 files) representing transcoded content residing in your Object Storage buckets. You can create content using OCI Media Flow or by using an external transcoding service. However, the content must be compliant with the ingest formats that Media Streams supports and must reside in the Object Storage buckets.

The DevOps build and deployment pipelines reduce change-driven errors and decreases the time customers spend on building and deploying releases. The service also provides private Git repositories to store your code and supports connections to external code repositories.\nWith the DevOps service you can do the following: \n\nCreate private code repositories to store and manage source code.\nConnect to external repositories such as GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket Cloud, Visual Builder Studio, Bitbucket Server, and GitLab Server.\nBuild and test your latest changes in a build pipeline with a service-managed build\n                runner.\nSet up a trigger to automatically run your build pipeline from a source code commit\n                or pull request. Optionally run a deployment pipeline on the successful build run\n                for a complete CI/CD automation.\nOrchestrate your software deployment across regions to OCI platforms such as\n                Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE), Compute instances, and Functions.\nAvoid downtime during deployments through the blue-green and canary deployment\n                strategies.\nAutomate the complexity of updating applications. Automation reduces the chance of\n                human error that might introduce a security vulnerability.\nEnhance security and reduce risk in delivery. As DevOps enables faster software\n                delivery, security bugs can be resolved quickly by rolling out a fix.\n\n\nFigure 1. DevOps Workflow\n\n\n\nWhether you're migrating workloads to OCI (from on-premises or other clouds) or\n            developing new applications on OCI, you can use the DevOps service to simplify your\n            software delivery lifecycle.\nYou can build, test, deliver, and deploy with DevOps by using the Oracle Cloud Console,\n            REST API, and CLI.

They can be public IP address of Virtual Cloud Networks (VCNs) within your tenancy. When a network source is provided in an IAM policy, the IAM validates the requests to access a resource originating from an allowed IP address. Follow the given steps to create IAM policies that limit access to Devops code repositories based on specified IP addresses: \n\nIn the Oracle Cloud Console, open the navigation menu and click Identity & Security. Under Network Sources, click Create Network Source. \n Enter a name and description.\nIn the Networks section, select the type of network you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re using and the respective IP addresses. \nTo provide access to public IP addresses or CIDR block ranges, select Public Network and provide the respective details.\nTo provide access to private IP addresses in your VCN, select Virtual Cloud Network, and select the VCN you want to allow. Enter the private IP address from the VCN or a subnet CIDR block. To allow all subnets from the specified VCN, enter 0.0.0.0/0.\n\nTo add more IP ranges to this network source, click Add Network.\nClick Create.\n\nAfter creating the network with the required IP addresses, you can create IAM policies to allow only the listed IP addresses to access DevOps code repositories. To scope your policy using a condition, you can use an IAM service variable. For example, request.networkSource.name. \nFollowing is a sample policy to allow only specified IP addresses to access the DevOps code repositories using devops-repository  as the resource type. Use the network source name that was created in the preceding steps: Allow group <group-name> to manage devops-repository in compartment <compartment_name> where request.networkSource.name='<network-source-name>'\nYou can modify the verbs used in the policy. For example, changing \"manage\" to \"inspect\" allows only listing of resources. For more information see, DevOps IAM policies.\nWhen accessing repositories, or performing Git operations on a repository from an IP address that isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t allowed, you might encounter an error.\n"

Note If  you already have a SSH key pair, then you can use the same. By default, SSH keys are stored in your system's ~/.ssh directory.To generate a SSH key pair, follow the given steps:\nOpen a terminal window.\n\nEnter the following command:\n\nssh-keygen -t rsa -C \"<user.alias>@\"\n\n\nAccept the default values when prompted.\nThe command will create a 3072-bit RSA key for use with SSH.\nYou can give a passphrase for your private key when prompted for security.\nThe command produces two keys needed for SSH authentication: Private key ( id_rsa ) and the Public key ( id_rsa.pub ). Keep your private key securely and do not share it.\n\nCopy the contents of the public key file. If you are using OpenSSH format key, use the following command: ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub -e -m pkcs8 | pbcopyIf you are using OCI API signing key, use the following command: cat ~/.oci/oci_api_key_public.pem | pbcopy\nUpload the public key to OCI and associate with your IAM user.

This storage is persistent from session to session, but after 6-months of non-use, the administrator for your tenancy will receive a notification that the storage will be removed in 60 days. Starting a cloud shell session resets the storage removal timer.\nCloud Shell does not support mounting additional storage.\nCloud Shell does not scan user files for malware or viruses.\nCloud Shell sessions do not allow for any incoming connections, and there is no\n                public IP address available.\nThe OCI CLI will execute commands against the region selected in the Console's Region selection menu when the Cloud Shell was started. Changing the region selection in the console will not change the region for existing Cloud Shell instances; you will need to open a new Cloud Shell instance to change regions.\nCloud Shell sessions have a maximum length of 24 hours, and time out after 60\n                minutes of inactivity.\n\nCloud Shell uses websockets to communicate between your browser and the service.\n                    If your browser has websockets disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has\n                    websockets disabled you will see an error message (\"An unexpected error\n                    occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud Shell from the console.\n\nCloud Shell is designed for interactive use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Users who need additional storage for Cloud Shell or want to run non-interactive long-running tasks are encouraged to use Compute and Storage resources in their tenancy.\nFor maximum compatibility, Cloud Shell includes Python version 2 and Python version\n                3. Python 2 is the default that will run when you enter 'python' at the command\n                line.

Attempting to create a Cloud Shell session when logged in with a user name (or the part of the name before the @ sign if the user name is an email address)\u00c2\u00a0that is one of these reserved words will result in an \"Unexpected Error\" message.\nEntirely numerical user names (for example, \"1234\")\u00c2\u00a0are not supported by Cloud Shell.\nThe Cloud Shell session time zone is UTC, and cannot be changed.\nCloud Shell does not allow root access or the use of sudo, so packages that require\n                root access for installation can't be installed. Many packages are available in\n                versions that do not require root for installation; you can unpack and install these\n                in your home directory. \nCloud Shell does not allow the use of ping, since ping requires root access.\nCloud Shell boots in FIPS mode, which might affect the behavior of some commands.\nCloud Shell cannot generate PKCS#1 keys when using the openssl command, because Cloud Shell boots in FIPS mode.

        "text": "oracle cloud infrastructure, oci, Service Mesh Overview service, \n Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Service Mesh allows you to add a set of capabilities that\n        enables microservices within a cloud native application to communicate with each other in a\n        centrally managed and secure manner. Adding a service mesh is done by deploying a proxy\n        alongside each microservice, which receives configuration information from a managed control\n        plane. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure(OCI) Service Mesh includes standardized patterns around\n        observability, security, and traffic management for communication between\n        microservices.\nCompanies continue to build net-new applications in a cloud native architecture or\n            modernize their applications using containerization techniques using microservice-based\n            approaches. Service Mesh makes it easier for you to develop and operate their cloud\n            native applications.\nWhy Service Mesh?\nWith a service mesh, you can automatically add features to your cloud native\n                microservice application. Manage security, control traffic, and add observability\n                features without changing your application's source code.\nWith Service Mesh you can:\n\nSecure: Access Policies are the major tool for injecting security\n                    components into the application while having no effect on the underlying\n                    programming logic. With access policies, a service mesh assists you in\n                    eliminating network partitioning at transport layer boundaries. You can use\n                    identities and encryption for all communication between mutually authenticated\n                    services by the service mesh. Adding permission checks imposed by policies you\n                    set, adopts a zero-trust security architecture, automatically and\n                    declaratively.\nConnect: Traffic Management features allow you to do canary deployment.\n                    When you publish a new version of your code to production, you only allow a\n                    portion of traffic to reach it. The feature enables you to deploy quicker and\n                    causes the least amount of disturbance to your application. You define routing\n                    rules that govern all inter-service communication inside the mesh. You might\n                    route a portion of the traffic to a certain version of the service.\nObserve: Service Mesh default Observability features collect telemetry\n                    data throughout the service mesh. Installing Prometheus and Grafana is all that\n                    is required to get started with crucial metrics like latency, failures, and\n                    requests. In addition, you might activate OCI Logging after your application is\n                    mesh enabled. Service Mesh proxies provide two types of logs: error logs and\n                    traffic logs. These logs might be used to generate log-based statistics or to\n                    debug 404 and 503 issues.\n\n\n"

By\n                default, Service Mesh denies external requests and requests between services.\n                Ingress gateways must be configured with routing rules to route external traffic to\n                virtual services. Access policies are required to allow traffic between virtual\n                services. In addition, access policies can be configured to allow egress traffic to\n                external services.\nUsing Service Mesh virtual deployments you can do canary deployment. Different\n                versions of a virtual service can be tracked with virtual deployments. When you\n                publish a new version of your code to production, a virtual service route table can\n                be configured to allow a portion of traffic to reach it. That way, new features are\n                deployed quicker and with the least amount of disturbance to your application.\n                Routing rules are flexible, and along with access policies, govern all inter-service\n                communication inside the mesh.\n\nRouting Traffic in a Virtual Service\nWhen traffic is directed toward a virtual service, it needs to be forwarded to a\n                virtual deployment. To forward the traffic, the virtual service evaluates the rules\n                specified in the attached virtual service route tables. The virtual service\n                processes virtual service route tables based on priority ordering. The first route\n                rule that is matched is applied and the traffic is directed to the virtual\n                deployments listed in the matched route rule.\nIf no virtual service route tables are defined for the virtual service, the default routing policy is used to direct traffic to the virtual deployments.\n\nUniform: If the routing policy is Uniform, then traffic is uniformly\n                    split across the virtual deployments.\nDeny: If the routing policy is Deny, then the traffic is blocked or\n                    dropped\n\nTo enforce that traffic is only directed to virtual deployments when virtual service\n                route rules are matched, set the default routing policy to Deny. That way,\n                only traffic matching a rule is forwarded. All other traffic is blocked.\n\n"

        "text": "oracle cloud infrastructure, oci, Cloud Shell service, \n Cloud Shell Limitations, \nKeep the following limitations in mind when using Cloud Shell:\n\nCloud Shell comes with 5GB\u00c2\u00a0of storage for the VM's home directory. This storage is persistent from session to session, but after 6-months of non-use, the administrator for your tenancy will receive a notification that the storage will be removed in 60 days. Starting a cloud shell session resets the storage removal timer.\nCloud Shell does not support mounting additional storage.\nCloud Shell does not scan user files for malware or viruses.\nCloud Shell sessions do not allow for any incoming connections, and there is no\n                public IP address available.\nThe OCI CLI will execute commands against the region selected in the Console's Region selection menu when the Cloud Shell was started. Changing the region selection in the console will not change the region for existing Cloud Shell instances; you will need to open a new Cloud Shell instance to change regions.\nCloud Shell sessions have a maximum length of 24 hours, and time out after 60\n                minutes of inactivity.\n\nCloud Shell uses websockets to communicate between your browser and the service.\n                    If your browser has websockets disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has\n                    websockets disabled you will see an error message (\"An unexpected error\n                    occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud Shell from the console.\n\nCloud Shell is designed for interactive use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Users who need additional storage for Cloud Shell or want to run non-interactive long-running tasks are encouraged to use Compute and Storage resources in their tenancy.\nFor maximum compatibility, Cloud Shell includes Python version 2 and Python version\n                3. Python 2 is the default that will run when you enter 'python' at the command\n                line. To run Python 3, enter 'python3' at the command line.\nThe following reserved words can't be used as the user name for a Cloud Shell user: oci, root, bin, daemon, adm, lp, sync, shutdown, halt, mai, operator, games, ftp, nobody, oci, systemd-network, dbus, polkitd, tss, and apache. Attempting to create a Cloud Shell session when logged in with a user name (or the part of the name before the @ sign if the user name is an email address)\u00c2\u00a0that is one of these reserved words will result in an \"Unexpected Error\" message.\nEntirely numerical user names (for example, \"1234\")\u00c2\u00a0are not supported by Cloud Shell.\nThe Cloud Shell session time zone is UTC, and cannot be changed.\nCloud Shell does not allow root access or the use of sudo, so packages that require\n                root access for installation can't be installed. Many packages are available in\n                versions that do not require root for installation; you can unpack and install these\n                in your home directory. \nCloud Shell does not allow the use of ping, since ping requires root access.\nCloud Shell boots in FIPS mode, which might affect the behavior of some commands.\nCloud Shell cannot generate PKCS#1 keys when using the openssl command, because Cloud Shell boots in FIPS mode. FIPS mode requires that Cloud Shell generates PKCS#8 keys.\nFor more information on Cloud Shell limits, see the Cloud Shell section in Service Limits. \n\nCloud Shell Access and Other Restrictions\nYou can access OCI resources from Cloud Shell according to the policies granted by\n                your tenancy administrator.

Examples of where Private Networking can be useful\n            include using it to SSH into compute instances inside of a private network or managing a\n            private OKE cluster.\n Note A Cloud Shell instance is a private instance, and works like a private instance for the purposes of network setup. Using only an internet gateway will not allow egress to the internet from a private subnet. Using a service gateway or a NAT gateway will. For more information, see the Internet Gateway documentation.\nRequirements and IAM Policy\nTo use Private Networking, you (or an administrator) will need to specify the\n                following policies:\n\n\nallow group <group> to use subnets in compartment <compartment>\n\n\nallow group <group> to use vnics in compartment <compartment>\n\n\nallow group <group> to use network-security-groups in compartment <compartment>\n\n\nallow group <group> to inspect vcns in compartment <compartment>\n\n\nIf you're new to policies, see Getting Started with Policies and Common Policies.\nYou'll also need to create private VCNs and Subnets in the appropriate compartments.\n                For more information, see VCNs and Subnets in\n                the Networking\n                documentation. \n\nGetting Started with Private NetworkingTo\n            change which network your Cloud Shell session is using, use the drop-down Network\n            menu at the top of the Cloud Shell terminal window:From this menu you can select a favorite private network connection.\n                To see more options, you can select the Private Network Definition List item,\n                which will display the Private Network Definition List panel. This\n                panel allows you to select additional private networks, and also designate favorite\n                private networks for quick selection (you can have up to 5 favorites):\nCreate a new private network definitionYou can create a\n                new private network definition by clicking the Create private network\n                    definition button.

Select the VCN and the Subnet to use from the drop-down list boxes. You can also\n                optionally select one or more Network Security groups to use.  Note Only VCNs and Subnets in your home region are available.\n                    If you need to access a subnet in a region that is not your home region, you can\n                    use peering from the subnet used by Private Networking to reach it. For more\n                    information, see VCN Cross-Region Peering.  Note A subnet chosen for a Cloudshell Private Network\n                            must have at least one non-reserved IP address for the subnet's CIDR\n                            block available.

In general,\n                organizations with many more resources are likely to have more problems, and thus a\n                higher risk scores. The risk score is closely related to the \"potential surface\n                area\" of risk. If you have many OCI resources, you might have an excellent security\n                score (overall assessment) and still have a higher risk score.\n\nViewing the Risk Score\n\nFrom the Cloud Guard options panel on the left, select\nOverview.\nView the Risk Score tile in the top center.\n\n\nHow the Risk Score is Calculated\n\nThe numeric risk score is updated every 15 minutes, and reflects the total\n                    number of problems that Cloud Guard has detected, the risk level of each\n                    problem, and the types of resources involved.\n                        Different\n                        categories of resources are more sensitive to security threats and that\n                        sensitivity weights the scoring. For example, users (IAM) and buckets are\n                        considered more sensitive, based on factors such as how easy they are to\n                        access and how they can be used as a target of attack.\nThe raw risk score that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s calculated is normalized to fall within the range of\n                    0-9,999. A risk score of zero would mean that no problems were detected for any\n                    resources. A high risk score generally means there are a larger number of\n                        problems that have higher risk levels (HIGH or CRITICAL). If the problems\n                        and the resources involved are less sensitive, a large number of problems\n                        doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t produce a high risk score. \nBest practice for security is to give priority to addressing the problems with\n                    the highest risk levels, that Cloud Guard\n                    detects on the most sensitive resources. Following this best practice also\n                    produces the greatest reduction in the risk score.\n\n Note\nThe risk score reflects monitoring for the past 30 days. Cloud Guard updates the risk score calculation\n                    continuously.\n\n"

In general,\n                organizations with many more resources are likely to have more problems, and thus a\n                higher risk scores. The risk score is closely related to the \"potential surface\n                area\" of risk. If you have many OCI resources, you might have an excellent security\n                score (overall assessment) and still have a higher risk score.\n\nViewing the Risk Score\n\nFrom the Cloud Guard options panel on the left, select\nOverview.\nView the Risk Score tile in the top center.\n\n\nHow the Risk Score is Calculated\n\nThe numeric risk score is updated every 15 minutes, and reflects the total\n                    number of problems that Cloud Guard has detected, the risk level of each\n                    problem, and the types of resources involved.\n                        Different\n                        categories of resources are more sensitive to security threats and that\n                        sensitivity weights the scoring. For example, users (IAM) and buckets are\n                        considered more sensitive, based on factors such as how easy they are to\n                        access and how they can be used as a target of attack.\nThe raw risk score that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s calculated is normalized to fall within the range of\n                    0-9,999. A risk score of zero would mean that no problems were detected for any\n                    resources. A high risk score generally means there are a larger number of\n                        problems that have higher risk levels (HIGH or CRITICAL). If the problems\n                        and the resources involved are less sensitive, a large number of problems\n                        doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t produce a high risk score. \nBest practice for security is to give priority to addressing the problems with\n                    the highest risk levels, that Cloud Guard\n                    detects on the most sensitive resources. Following this best practice also\n                    produces the greatest reduction in the risk score.\n\n Note\nThe risk score reflects monitoring for the past 30 days. Cloud Guard updates the risk score calculation\n                    continuously.\n\n"

        "text": "oracle cloud infrastructure, oci, Getting Summary Information on the Overview Page service, \n Understanding the Risk Score, The Risk Score on the Overview page provides a rough estimate of the risk level to your\n        environment that's posed by the problems that Cloud Guard\n        detects.\n\nThe risk score is related to the number and severity of problems. In general,\n                organizations with many more resources are likely to have more problems, and thus a\n                higher risk scores. The risk score is closely related to the \"potential surface\n                area\" of risk. If you have many OCI resources, you might have an excellent security\n                score (overall assessment) and still have a higher risk score.\n\nViewing the Risk Score\n\nFrom the Cloud Guard options panel on the left, select\nOverview.\nView the Risk Score tile in the top center.\n\n\nHow the Risk Score is Calculated\n\nThe numeric risk score is updated every 15 minutes, and reflects the total\n                    number of problems that Cloud Guard has detected, the risk level of each\n                    problem, and the types of resources involved.\n                        Different\n                        categories of resources are more sensitive to security threats and that\n                        sensitivity weights the scoring. For example, users (IAM) and buckets are\n                        considered more sensitive, based on factors such as how easy they are to\n                        access and how they can be used as a target of attack.\nThe raw risk score that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s calculated is normalized to fall within the range of\n                    0-9,999. A risk score of zero would mean that no problems were detected for any\n                    resources. A high risk score generally means there are a larger number of\n                        problems that have higher risk levels (HIGH or CRITICAL). If the problems\n                        and the resources involved are less sensitive, a large number of problems\n                        doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t produce a high risk score. \nBest practice for security is to give priority to addressing the problems with\n                    the highest risk levels, that Cloud Guard\n                    detects on the most sensitive resources. Following this best practice also\n                    produces the greatest reduction in the risk score.\n\n Note\nThe risk score reflects monitoring for the past 30 days. Cloud Guard updates the risk score calculation\n                    continuously.\n\n"

        "text": "oracle cloud infrastructure, oci, Getting Summary Information on the Overview Page service, \n Understanding the Risk Score, The Risk Score on the Overview page provides a rough estimate of the risk level to your\n        environment that's posed by the problems that Cloud Guard\n        detects.\n\nThe risk score is related to the number and severity of problems. In general,\n                organizations with many more resources are likely to have more problems, and thus a\n                higher risk scores. The risk score is closely related to the \"potential surface\n                area\" of risk. If you have many OCI resources, you might have an excellent security\n                score (overall assessment) and still have a higher risk score.\n\nViewing the Risk Score\n\nFrom the Cloud Guard options panel on the left, select\nOverview.\nView the Risk Score tile in the top center.\n\n\nHow the Risk Score is Calculated\n\nThe numeric risk score is updated every 15 minutes, and reflects the total\n                    number of problems that Cloud Guard has detected, the risk level of each\n                    problem, and the types of resources involved.\n                        Different\n                        categories of resources are more sensitive to security threats and that\n                        sensitivity weights the scoring. For example, users (IAM) and buckets are\n                        considered more sensitive, based on factors such as how easy they are to\n                        access and how they can be used as a target of attack.\nThe raw risk score that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s calculated is normalized to fall within the range of\n                    0-9,999. A risk score of zero would mean that no problems were detected for any\n                    resources. A high risk score generally means there are a larger number of\n                        problems that have higher risk levels (HIGH or CRITICAL). If the problems\n                        and the resources involved are less sensitive, a large number of problems\n                        doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t produce a high risk score. \nBest practice for security is to give priority to addressing the problems with\n                    the highest risk levels, that Cloud Guard\n                    detects on the most sensitive resources. Following this best practice also\n                    produces the greatest reduction in the risk score.\n\n Note\nThe risk score reflects monitoring for the past 30 days. Cloud Guard updates the risk score calculation\n                    continuously.\n\n"

This storage is persistent from session to session, but after 6-months of non-use, the administrator for your tenancy will receive a notification that the storage will be removed in 60 days. Starting a cloud shell session resets the storage removal timer.\nCloud Shell does not support mounting additional storage.\nCloud Shell does not scan user files for malware or viruses.\nCloud Shell sessions do not allow for any incoming connections, and there is no\n                public IP address available.\nThe OCI CLI will execute commands against the region selected in the Console's Region selection menu when the Cloud Shell was started. Changing the region selection in the console will not change the region for existing Cloud Shell instances; you will need to open a new Cloud Shell instance to change regions.\nCloud Shell sessions have a maximum length of 24 hours, and time out after 60\n                minutes of inactivity.\n\nCloud Shell uses websockets to communicate between your browser and the service.\n                    If your browser has websockets disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has\n                    websockets disabled you will see an error message (\"An unexpected error\n                    occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud Shell from the console.\n\nCloud Shell is designed for interactive use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Users who need additional storage for Cloud Shell or want to run non-interactive long-running tasks are encouraged to use Compute and Storage resources in their tenancy.\nFor maximum compatibility, Cloud Shell includes Python version 2 and Python version\n                3. Python 2 is the default that will run when you enter 'python' at the command\n                line. To run Python 3, enter 'python3' at the command line.\nThe following reserved words can't be used as the user name for a Cloud Shell user: oci, root, bin, daemon, adm, lp, sync, shutdown, halt, mai, operator, games, ftp, nobody, oci, systemd-network, dbus, polkitd, tss, and apache. Attempting to create a Cloud Shell session when logged in with a user name (or the part of the name before the @ sign if the user name is an email address)\u00c2\u00a0that is one of these reserved words will result in an \"Unexpected Error\" message.\nEntirely numerical user names (for example, \"1234\")\u00c2\u00a0are not supported by Cloud Shell.\nThe Cloud Shell session time zone is UTC, and cannot be changed.\nCloud Shell does not allow root access or the use of sudo, so packages that require\n                root access for installation can't be installed. Many packages are available in\n                versions that do not require root for installation; you can unpack and install these\n                in your home directory. \nCloud Shell does not allow the use of ping, since ping requires root access.\nCloud Shell boots in FIPS mode, which might affect the behavior of some commands.\nCloud Shell cannot generate PKCS#1 keys when using the openssl command, because Cloud Shell boots in FIPS mode. FIPS mode requires that Cloud Shell generates PKCS#8 keys.\nFor more information on Cloud Shell limits, see the Cloud Shell section in Service Limits. \n\nCloud Shell Access and Other Restrictions\nYou can access OCI resources from Cloud Shell according to the policies granted by\n                your tenancy administrator. There is no additional access because you're using Cloud\n                Shell, and Cloud Shell does not provide any additional access to your tenancy, or\n                private resources in your tenancy VCNs. Note Cloud Shell uses websockets to\n                    communicate between your browser and the service. If your browser has websockets\n                    disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has websockets disabled you will see an\n                    error message (\"An unexpected error occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud\n                    Shell from the console.\nWhile Cloud Shell provides access to the internet, there is no ingress from the\n                outside world into Cloud Shell (for example: you cannot ssh in to Cloud Shell) and\n                no public IP address available.

For more information, see the Internet Gateway documentation.\nRequirements and IAM Policy\nTo use Private Networking, you (or an administrator) will need to specify the\n                following policies:\n\n\nallow group <group> to use subnets in compartment <compartment>\n\n\nallow group <group> to use vnics in compartment <compartment>\n\n\nallow group <group> to use network-security-groups in compartment <compartment>\n\n\nallow group <group> to inspect vcns in compartment <compartment>\n\n\nIf you're new to policies, see Getting Started with Policies and Common Policies.\nYou'll also need to create private VCNs and Subnets in the appropriate compartments.\n                For more information, see VCNs and Subnets in\n                the Networking\n                documentation. \n\nGetting Started with Private NetworkingTo\n            change which network your Cloud Shell session is using, use the drop-down Network\n            menu at the top of the Cloud Shell terminal window:From this menu you can select a favorite private network connection.\n                To see more options, you can select the Private Network Definition List item,\n                which will display the Private Network Definition List panel. This\n                panel allows you to select additional private networks, and also designate favorite\n                private networks for quick selection (you can have up to 5 favorites):\nCreate a new private network definitionYou can create a\n                new private network definition by clicking the Create private network\n                    definition button. This will bring up the Create Private Network\n                    Definition panel.  Note To create a temporary\n                    ephemeral network, select Ephemeral Private Network Setup from the\n                    network selection drop-down. This is temporary network is only valid for the\n                    length of your Cloud Shell session, and will not be persisted to your list of\n                    defined private networks.Enter a name for your private network\n                definition in the Name text box. Select the VCN and the Subnet to use from the drop-down list boxes. You can also\n                optionally select one or more Network Security groups to use.  Note Only VCNs and Subnets in your home region are available.\n                    If you need to access a subnet in a region that is not your home region, you can\n                    use peering from the subnet used by Private Networking to reach it. For more\n                    information, see VCN Cross-Region Peering.  Note A subnet chosen for a Cloudshell Private Network\n                            must have at least one non-reserved IP address for the subnet's CIDR\n                            block available. If all non-reserved IP addresses have been allocated,\n                            Cloudshell cannot attach to that subnet.For example: If you want to set this definition as the active network,\n                enable the Use as network checkbox.Click the Create button to\n                create your Cloud Shell private network definition.Your Cloud Shell session\n                is now connected to your private network, as indicated in the Networking\n                drop-down at the top of the Cloud Shell terminal session:You can see details about your private network connection by clicking\n                the Details link:\n"

This storage is persistent from session to session, but after 6-months of non-use, the administrator for your tenancy will receive a notification that the storage will be removed in 60 days. Starting a cloud shell session resets the storage removal timer.\nCloud Shell does not support mounting additional storage.\nCloud Shell does not scan user files for malware or viruses.\nCloud Shell sessions do not allow for any incoming connections, and there is no\n                public IP address available.\nThe OCI CLI will execute commands against the region selected in the Console's Region selection menu when the Cloud Shell was started. Changing the region selection in the console will not change the region for existing Cloud Shell instances; you will need to open a new Cloud Shell instance to change regions.\nCloud Shell sessions have a maximum length of 24 hours, and time out after 60\n                minutes of inactivity.\n\nCloud Shell uses websockets to communicate between your browser and the service.\n                    If your browser has websockets disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has\n                    websockets disabled you will see an error message (\"An unexpected error\n                    occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud Shell from the console.\n\nCloud Shell is designed for interactive use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Users who need additional storage for Cloud Shell or want to run non-interactive long-running tasks are encouraged to use Compute and Storage resources in their tenancy.\nFor maximum compatibility, Cloud Shell includes Python version 2 and Python version\n                3. Python 2 is the default that will run when you enter 'python' at the command\n                line. To run Python 3, enter 'python3' at the command line.\nThe following reserved words can't be used as the user name for a Cloud Shell user: oci, root, bin, daemon, adm, lp, sync, shutdown, halt, mai, operator, games, ftp, nobody, oci, systemd-network, dbus, polkitd, tss, and apache. Attempting to create a Cloud Shell session when logged in with a user name (or the part of the name before the @ sign if the user name is an email address)\u00c2\u00a0that is one of these reserved words will result in an \"Unexpected Error\" message.\nEntirely numerical user names (for example, \"1234\")\u00c2\u00a0are not supported by Cloud Shell.\nThe Cloud Shell session time zone is UTC, and cannot be changed.\nCloud Shell does not allow root access or the use of sudo, so packages that require\n                root access for installation can't be installed. Many packages are available in\n                versions that do not require root for installation; you can unpack and install these\n                in your home directory. \nCloud Shell does not allow the use of ping, since ping requires root access.\nCloud Shell boots in FIPS mode, which might affect the behavior of some commands.\nCloud Shell cannot generate PKCS#1 keys when using the openssl command, because Cloud Shell boots in FIPS mode. FIPS mode requires that Cloud Shell generates PKCS#8 keys.\nFor more information on Cloud Shell limits, see the Cloud Shell section in Service Limits. \n\nCloud Shell Access and Other Restrictions\nYou can access OCI resources from Cloud Shell according to the policies granted by\n                your tenancy administrator. There is no additional access because you're using Cloud\n                Shell, and Cloud Shell does not provide any additional access to your tenancy, or\n                private resources in your tenancy VCNs. Note Cloud Shell uses websockets to\n                    communicate between your browser and the service. If your browser has websockets\n                    disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has websockets disabled you will see an\n                    error message (\"An unexpected error occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud\n                    Shell from the console.\nWhile Cloud Shell provides access to the internet, there is no ingress from the\n                outside world into Cloud Shell (for example: you cannot ssh in to Cloud Shell) and\n                no public IP address available. If your tenancy admin does not want to enable access\n                to the internet from OCI, they should not grant access to Cloud Shell with an IAM\n                policy.\n\n"

The type of node is what determines the\n                    functionality and tasks performed by the instance. Each cluster is composed of\n                    one or more data nodes, master nodes, and OpenSearch Dashboard nodes.\nData Node\nData nodes store the data for OpenSearch and handle the operations related to\n                    searching, managing, and aggregating the OpenSearch data. A node configured for\n                    the data role can fill any of the specialized data node roles. When configuring\n                    your cluster's data nodes, the minimum memory required per node is 20 GB.\nMaster Node\n\nMaster nodes manage the cluster operations, monitor the node status, and\n                        route the network traffic for the cluster. The master node is responsible\n                        for cluster-wide actions such as creating or deleting an index, tracking\n                        which nodes are part of the cluster, and deciding which shards to allocate\n                        to which nodes. Stable master nodes are important for cluster health. When\n                        configuring your cluster's master nodes, the minimum memory required per\n                        node is 20 GB.\n\nOpenSearch Dashboard Node\nOpenSearch Dashboard nodes manage and provide access to the OpenSearch\n                    Dashboards for your cluster. When configuring your cluster's OpenSearch\n                    Dashboard, the minimum memory required per node is 8 GB.\nOpenSearch Dashboards\nOpenSearch Dashboards are a visualization tool for your OpenSearch data and can\n                    also be used as the user interface for some OpenSearch plugins. They enable you\n                    to create interactive data dashboards with real-time data.\nPrivate Endpoints\nWhen you create a cluster, Search with OpenSearch sets up private endpoints to\n                    provide access to the cluster and the cluster's OpenSearch Dashboards. This\n                    network setup ensures that all network traffic stays within the cluster's VCN in\n                    the tenancy. For more information, see Private Endpoints. To create a cluster, you need to configure the required service permissions\n                    for Search with OpenSearch to create private\n                    endpoints, see Service Permissions. \n\n"

While the service is patching a cluster's instances,\n            the search functionality is in read-only mode.

The length of the\n            maintenance window is related to an OpenSearch cluster's total number of shards and\n            indices.

This might impose restrictions in anomaly detection scenarios where a large number of data points typically in the millions need to be detected. You can analyze and detect anomalies in very large datasets upwards of 10 million data points.\n\nAutomating detection workflows\n\nIn IoT use cases, time series data is usually collected from large number of sensors and devices, and stored in a persistent data store such as a database or a file system. Often, this raw data has to be preprocessed (enriched) using PaaS services such as Data Flow before performing inferencing. You can easily integrate the asynchronous detection API's within data processing pipelines, and automate detection workflows.\n\nPostprocessing anomalous events\n\nIn certain anomaly detection scenarios, the detection data (detected anomalies) might need to be transformed or enriched before it can be consumed by downstream applications. With asynchronous detection, detected anomalies are saved in an Object Store bucket. You can use PaaS services such as Data Flow to analyze, process, and enrich the anomalous events. Furthermore, you can consume and render the anomalies in visualization graphs in Oracle Analytics Cloud to enable you to monitor target systems and take corrective actions.\n\n\n"

Anomaly Detection helps you define business-specific alerts and actions. It also helps you to identify anomalies in multivariate and univariate datasets by either taking advantage of interrelationships between signals or by identifying trend in individual signals.\nThe anomaly detection service uses an innovative statistical method that helps to identify anomalies at the earliest possible time. Also, it productizes univariate and multivariate state estimation methods with sequential probability ratio test techniques, see key terms. \n"

This section defines how Oracle calculates these\n            metrics, and highlights any assumptions underlying the values presented in Oracle\n            Pulse.\nAvailability is a defining principle of ITIL service delivery, and Oracle services\n            follow ITIL principles for calculating availability. Following these principles,\n            availability is the percentage of time when a production service is operating as\n            expected. In practice, this means that end users can log in and perform all business\n            transactions.\nAvailability calculations take into account only unplanned complete outages for\n            your production environments, for which Oracle is responsible. Such outages mean that\n            end users experience total loss of service - they cannot log in or perform any business\n            transactions. Users logged in when the outage starts cannot complete current actions. If\n            the customer organization is responsible for restoring service - for example, carrying\n            out necessary repairs - the outage is not included in availability calculations.\nThese calculations also exclude planned maintenance outages for your production\n            environments, where the outage occurs at an agreed date and time due to regular\n            maintenance or a customer change request.\nIf isolated business transactions cannot be completed in your production environments,\n            but other service transactions can be performed, this is considered a service\n                interruption and does not affect availability calculations.\nThe Pulse Dashboard summarizes information about the uptime and the count of\n                unplanned outages that occurred in your production environments, as well as\n            information about the total duration of unplanned complete outages, service\n            interruptions and planned production maintenance outages for the current month or for\n            the month indicated.

This includes a base entitlement, and any additional storage purchased either initially or through additions to the contract. Your organization's entitlement is tracked manually by your Oracle customer management team.\nUsing Oracle Pulse, you can monitor both your organization's storage entitlement and the amount of storage your organization consumes. Storage resources can be located @customer or @partner, termed customer-owned storage. Customer-owned storage includes all storage located in your organization's data centers and those belonging to partner organizations. It also includes any Oracle Exadata and Exalogic servers that your organization owns in Oracle data centers. Oracle-owned storage covers all storage used in Oracle services Data Centers, excluding any servers that your organization owns.\nConsumed storage includes the amount of commercial storage allocated for your organization's services on Oracle-owned storage. Commercial storage usually includes all storage used by applications such as Oracle\u00c2\u00ae E-Business Suite and the tools needed to run those applications. Tools could include Oracle Database storage or Database and application software. Commercial storage excludes mirrored file systems, backups, and other items that are considered non-commercial storage.\nConsumed storage is deducted from your running storage entitlement. The consumed storage value also includes non-commercial storage consumption and usage of your organization's own storage resources. This makes consumed storage an important tool for managing your storage and forecasting future use.\nThe Pulse Dashboard summarizes storage usage against entitlement, and shows any changes in recent storage activity. Significant changes in either measure warrant immediate investigation. For more information, see the  Analyzing Storage section in Checking the Performance of Your Services.\nThe Storage dashboard at Customer and Service Level covers storage usage across all your organization's services and associated environments, allowing you to:\n\n\nanalyze storage usage. For more information, see the following sections in Using the Storage Reports:\n\nTotal Storage: Usage Table\nStorage Usage by Service Chart\nExadata: Usage Table\nExalogic: Usage Table\nStorage: Usage Table\n\n\n\nanalyze storage growth.

This storage is persistent from session to session, but after 6-months of non-use, the administrator for your tenancy will receive a notification that the storage will be removed in 60 days. Starting a cloud shell session resets the storage removal timer.\nCloud Shell does not support mounting additional storage.\nCloud Shell does not scan user files for malware or viruses.\nCloud Shell sessions do not allow for any incoming connections, and there is no\n                public IP address available.\nThe OCI CLI will execute commands against the region selected in the Console's Region selection menu when the Cloud Shell was started. Changing the region selection in the console will not change the region for existing Cloud Shell instances; you will need to open a new Cloud Shell instance to change regions.\nCloud Shell sessions have a maximum length of 24 hours, and time out after 60\n                minutes of inactivity.\n\nCloud Shell uses websockets to communicate between your browser and the service.\n                    If your browser has websockets disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has\n                    websockets disabled you will see an error message (\"An unexpected error\n                    occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud Shell from the console.\n\nCloud Shell is designed for interactive use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Users who need additional storage for Cloud Shell or want to run non-interactive long-running tasks are encouraged to use Compute and Storage resources in their tenancy.\nFor maximum compatibility, Cloud Shell includes Python version 2 and Python version\n                3. Python 2 is the default that will run when you enter 'python' at the command\n                line. To run Python 3, enter 'python3' at the command line.\nThe following reserved words can't be used as the user name for a Cloud Shell user: oci, root, bin, daemon, adm, lp, sync, shutdown, halt, mai, operator, games, ftp, nobody, oci, systemd-network, dbus, polkitd, tss, and apache. Attempting to create a Cloud Shell session when logged in with a user name (or the part of the name before the @ sign if the user name is an email address)\u00c2\u00a0that is one of these reserved words will result in an \"Unexpected Error\" message.\nEntirely numerical user names (for example, \"1234\")\u00c2\u00a0are not supported by Cloud Shell.\nThe Cloud Shell session time zone is UTC, and cannot be changed.\nCloud Shell does not allow root access or the use of sudo, so packages that require\n                root access for installation can't be installed. Many packages are available in\n                versions that do not require root for installation; you can unpack and install these\n                in your home directory. \nCloud Shell does not allow the use of ping, since ping requires root access.\nCloud Shell boots in FIPS mode, which might affect the behavior of some commands.\nCloud Shell cannot generate PKCS#1 keys when using the openssl command, because Cloud Shell boots in FIPS mode. FIPS mode requires that Cloud Shell generates PKCS#8 keys.\nFor more information on Cloud Shell limits, see the Cloud Shell section in Service Limits. \n\nCloud Shell Access and Other Restrictions\nYou can access OCI resources from Cloud Shell according to the policies granted by\n                your tenancy administrator. There is no additional access because you're using Cloud\n                Shell, and Cloud Shell does not provide any additional access to your tenancy, or\n                private resources in your tenancy VCNs. Note Cloud Shell uses websockets to\n                    communicate between your browser and the service. If your browser has websockets\n                    disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has websockets disabled you will see an\n                    error message (\"An unexpected error occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud\n                    Shell from the console.\nWhile Cloud Shell provides access to the internet, there is no ingress from the\n                outside world into Cloud Shell (for example: you cannot ssh in to Cloud Shell) and\n                no public IP address available.

        "text": "oracle cloud infrastructure, oci, Container Registry Concepts service, \n Images, \nContainer Registry is an  Open Container\n                Initiative-compliant registry. As a result, you can store any artifacts that\n            conform to Open Container Initiative specifications, such as Docker images, manifest\n            lists (sometimes known as multi-architecture images), and Helm charts. The instructions\n            in this documentation assume you are storing and retrieving Docker container images\n            using the Docker CLI. Docker container images are commonly referred to as Docker images,\n            or simply as images.\nA Docker image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container.\n            A Docker image holds the application that you want Docker to run as a container, along\n            with any dependencies. To create a Docker image, you first create a Dockerfile to\n            describe that application. You then build the Docker image from the Dockerfile. Having\n            created a Docker image, you store it in a Docker registry such as Container Registry.\nTypically, you'll group together different versions of the same Docker image into a named\n            repository in the registry (for example, into a repository named\n            'project01/acme-web-app'), and give each image version a different tag (for example,\n            '4.6.3'). So each image in the registry is uniquely identified by the combination of its\n            repository name and its tag (for example, 'project01/acme-web-app:4.6.3',\n            'project01/acme-web-app:4.6.4', and so on).\n"

        "text": "oracle cloud infrastructure, oci, Container Registry Concepts service, \n Repositories, \nA repository is a meaningfully named collection of related images grouped together for\n            convenience in Container Registry. Typically, you'll group\n            together different versions of the same source image into the same repository (for\n            example, into a repository named project01/acme-web-app), and give each\n            image version a different tag (for example, 4.6.3). So each image in\n            the registry is uniquely identified by the combination of its repository name and its\n            tag (for example, project01/acme-web-app:4.6.3,\n                project01/acme-web-app:4.6.4, and so on).\nRepositories can be private or public.  Any user with internet access and knowledge of the appropriate URL can pull images from a public repository  in Container Registry. \nA repository exists within a particular tenancy, region, and compartment. When referring\n            to the tenancy that owns a repository, you specify the tenancy's namespace. The tenancy\n            namespace is an auto-generated random string of alphanumeric characters. For example,\n            the namespace of the acme-dev tenancy might be\n                ansh81vru1zp. Note that for some older tenancies, the namespace\n            string might be the same as the tenancy name in all lower-case letters (for example,\n                acme-dev). To find out the tenancy namespace of the current\n            tenancy, open the  Profile menu () and click\n                Tenancy:. \nYou must belong to the tenancy's Administrators group or have been granted the REPOSITORY_MANAGE permission to:\n\ncreate a new public repository\nchange an existing repository into a public repository\nchange an existing public repository into a private repository\n\nIf you make a repository private, you (along with users belonging to the tenancy's\n            Administrators group) will be able to perform any operation on the repository. You can\n            use identity policies to allow other users to perform other operations on repositories\n            (both public and private) that you create. \nUsually, before pushing any images, you'll create an empty repository in a compartment\n            and give the repository a name (for example, project01/acme-web-app).\n            If you belong to the tenancy's Administrators group or have been granted the\n            REPOSITORY_MANAGE permission, you can also specify whether the repository is to be\n            private or public (see Policies to Control Repository Access). Having created the\n            repository, images you subsequently push to Container Registry that include the repository name are pushed to that repository. \nFor example, for convenience you might want to group together multiple versions of an\n            image in the acme-dev tenancy in the Ashburn region into the repository called\n                project01/acme-web-app. First, you create the\n                project01/acme-web-app repository. Then, you include the name of\n            the repository when you push the image, in the format\n                <region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>:<tag>.\n            For example, iad.ocir.io/ansh81vru1zp/project01/acme-web-app:4.6.3. \nNote that creating an empty repository in advance of pushing an image is almost certainly\n            going to be your normal workflow. And if you're only authorized to manage repositories\n            in compartments and not in the tenancy's root compartment, you'll always have to create\n            a repository before pushing an image. However, if you're in the unusual position of\n            mostly intending to push images to the root compartment, creating an empty repository in\n            advance is not strictly necessary.

It has the following\n                        structure:\n<region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>\nFor example:\n\niad.ocir.io/ansh81vru1zp/project01/acme-web-app\nus-phoenix-1.ocir.io/cbujx0t3wa3r/my-hello-app\n\n\nregion key\n\nA region key (sometimes referred to as <region-key> in\n                        this documentation) identifies the Container Registry region you are using.\nFor example:\n\niad.ocir.io\nus-phoenix-1.ocir.io\n\nFor the list of region keys, see Availability by Region.\n\ntenancy namespace\n\nA tenancy namespace (sometimes referred to as\n                            <tenancy-namespace> in this documentation) is an\n                        auto-generated, random, and immutable string of alphanumeric characters. For\n                        example, the namespace of the acme-dev tenancy might be\n                            ansh81vru1zp. \nNote that for some older tenancies, the namespace string might be the same as\n                        the tenancy name in all lower-case letters (for example,\n                            acme-dev). To find out the tenancy namespace of the\n                        current tenancy, open the  Profile menu () and click\n                            Tenancy:. The tenancy namespace is shown in the Object Storage\n                            Namespace field.\n\nrepository name\n\nA repository name (sometimes referred to as <repo-name>\n                        in this documentation) is the name of a repository in Container Registry, to and from which you can\n                        push and pull images. Repository names can include one or more slash\n                        characters, and are unique across all compartments in the entire\n                        tenancy.\nFor example:\n\nproject01/acme-web-app\nproject01/my-test-app\nmy-hello-app\nproject01/acme-web-app/component1\nproject01/acme-web-app/component2\nproject01/acme-web-app/component1/subcomponent1\n\nNote that although a repository name can include slash characters, the slash\n                        does not represent a hierarchical directory structure. It is simply one\n                        character in a string of characters. As a convenience, you might choose to\n                        start the names of several different repositories with the same string,\n                        perhaps ending in a slash (such as project01/). Such a\n                        string is sometimes called a 'repository name prefix'. But a repository\n                        named project01/acme-web-app need not have any relationship\n                        with a repository named project01/my-test-app. Using the\n                        same repository name prefix for some repositories simply makes it easier to\n                        organize and control access to them in Container Registry, which can contain many other\n                        repositories.\n\nregistry identifier\n\nA registry identifier is a Container Registry region\n                        key and a tenancy namespace. It has the following structure:\n<region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>\nFor example:\n\niad.ocir.io/ansh81vru1zp\nus-phoenix-1.ocir.io/cbujx0t3wa3r\n\n\nimage path\n\nAn image path is the fully-qualified path to a particular image in a\n                        registry. It extends the repository path by adding the tag associated with\n                        the image. It has the\n                        structure:<region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>:<tag>\nFor example:\n\niad.ocir.io/ansh81vru1zp/project01/acme-web-app:version2.0.test\nus-phoenix-1.ocir.io/cbujx0t3wa3r/my-hello-app:latest\n\n\ntag\n\nA tag or image tag (sometimes referred to as <tag> in\n                        this documentation) is a string used to refer to a particular image in a\n                        known repository. For example:\n\n4.6.3\n4.6.4\nversion2.0.test\n\n\nimage name\n\nThe term 'image name' is sometimes used as a short-hand way to refer to a\n                        particular image in a particular repository. In this context, an image name\n                        has the structure:\n<repo-name>:<tag>\n For example:\n\nproject01/acme-web-app:4.6.3\nproject01/acme-web-app:4.6.4\nmy-hello-app:latest\n\n\n\n"

Managing these vulnerabilities enables you to strengthen the security\n            posture of your system, and respond quickly when new vulnerabilities are discovered.\nYou can set up Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry (also known as Container Registry) to scan images in a repository for security vulnerabilities published in the publicly available Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database. \nYou enable image scanning by adding an image scanner to a repository.

This storage is persistent from session to session, but after 6-months of non-use, the administrator for your tenancy will receive a notification that the storage will be removed in 60 days. Starting a cloud shell session resets the storage removal timer.\nCloud Shell does not support mounting additional storage.\nCloud Shell does not scan user files for malware or viruses.\nCloud Shell sessions do not allow for any incoming connections, and there is no\n                public IP address available.\nThe OCI CLI will execute commands against the region selected in the Console's Region selection menu when the Cloud Shell was started. Changing the region selection in the console will not change the region for existing Cloud Shell instances; you will need to open a new Cloud Shell instance to change regions.\nCloud Shell sessions have a maximum length of 24 hours, and time out after 60\n                minutes of inactivity.\n\nCloud Shell uses websockets to communicate between your browser and the service.\n                    If your browser has websockets disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has\n                    websockets disabled you will see an error message (\"An unexpected error\n                    occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud Shell from the console.\n\nCloud Shell is designed for interactive use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Users who need additional storage for Cloud Shell or want to run non-interactive long-running tasks are encouraged to use Compute and Storage resources in their tenancy.\nFor maximum compatibility, Cloud Shell includes Python version 2 and Python version\n                3. Python 2 is the default that will run when you enter 'python' at the command\n                line. To run Python 3, enter 'python3' at the command line.\nThe following reserved words can't be used as the user name for a Cloud Shell user: oci, root, bin, daemon, adm, lp, sync, shutdown, halt, mai, operator, games, ftp, nobody, oci, systemd-network, dbus, polkitd, tss, and apache. Attempting to create a Cloud Shell session when logged in with a user name (or the part of the name before the @ sign if the user name is an email address)\u00c2\u00a0that is one of these reserved words will result in an \"Unexpected Error\" message.\nEntirely numerical user names (for example, \"1234\")\u00c2\u00a0are not supported by Cloud Shell.\nThe Cloud Shell session time zone is UTC, and cannot be changed.\nCloud Shell does not allow root access or the use of sudo, so packages that require\n                root access for installation can't be installed. Many packages are available in\n                versions that do not require root for installation; you can unpack and install these\n                in your home directory. \nCloud Shell does not allow the use of ping, since ping requires root access.\nCloud Shell boots in FIPS mode, which might affect the behavior of some commands.\nCloud Shell cannot generate PKCS#1 keys when using the openssl command, because Cloud Shell boots in FIPS mode. FIPS mode requires that Cloud Shell generates PKCS#8 keys.\nFor more information on Cloud Shell limits, see the Cloud Shell section in Service Limits. \n\nCloud Shell Access and Other Restrictions\nYou can access OCI resources from Cloud Shell according to the policies granted by\n                your tenancy administrator. There is no additional access because you're using Cloud\n                Shell, and Cloud Shell does not provide any additional access to your tenancy, or\n                private resources in your tenancy VCNs.

If the backend server resides within the same VCN as the load balancer, Oracle recommends that you specify the compute instance's private IP address. If the backend server resides within a different VCN, you must specify the public IP address of the compute instance. You also must ensure that the VCN's security rules allow Internet traffic. \n Important \nWhen you add backend servers to a backend set, you specify either the instance\n                    OCID or an IP address for the server to add. An instance with multiple VNICs\n                    attached can have multiple IP addresses pointing to it.\n\n\nIf you identify a backend server by OCID, Load Balancing uses the primary\n                            VNIC's primary private IP address.\n\n\nIf you identify the backend servers to add to a backend set by their IP\n                            addresses, it is possible to point to the same instance more than\n                            once.\n\n\nTo enable backend traffic, your backend server subnets must have appropriate ingress and egress security rules. When you add backend servers to a backend set, you can specify the applicable network security groups (NSGs). If you prefer to use security lists for your VCN, the Load Balancer service Console can suggest security list rules for you. You also can configure them yourself through the Networking service. See Security Lists for more information.\n Note\nTo accommodate high-volume traffic, Oracle strongly recommends that you use stateless security rules for your load balancer subnets. See Stateful Versus Stateless Rules for more information.\n\nYou can add and remove backend servers without disrupting traffic.\n Note\nYou can set up backend servers as compute instance pools.

For example, before upgrading the\n                existing cluster, you might create a new separate cluster with the new Kubernetes\n                version to test your applications.\nThe versions of Kubernetes running on the control plane nodes and the worker nodes\n                must be compatible (that is, the Kubernetes version on the control plane nodes must\n                be no more than two minor versions ahead of the Kubernetes version on the worker\n                nodes). See the Kubernetes version skew support policy\n                described in the Kubernetes documentation. \nIf the version of Kubernetes currently running on the control plane nodes is more\n                than one version behind the most recent supported version, you are given a choice of\n                versions to upgrade to. If you want to upgrade to a version of Kubernetes that is\n                more than one version ahead of the version currently running on the control plane\n                nodes, you must upgrade to each intermediate version in sequence without skipping\n                versions (as described in the Kubernetes documentation). \n\nTo successfully upgrade control plane nodes in a cluster, the Kubernetes\n                    Dashboard service must be of type ClusterIP. If the Kubernetes Dashboard service\n                    is not of type ClusterIP (for example, if the service is of type NodePort), the\n                    upgrade will fail. In this case, change the type of the Kubernetes Dashboard\n                    service back to ClusterIP (for example, by entering kubectl -n\n                        kube-system edit service kubernetes-dashboard and changing the\n                    type).\n\nPrior to Kubernetes version 1.14, Container Engine for Kubernetes created clusters with kube-dns as the DNS server. However, from Kubernetes version 1.14 onwards, Container Engine for Kubernetes creates clusters with CoreDNS as the DNS server. When you upgrade a cluster created by Container Engine for Kubernetes from an earlier version to Kubernetes 1.14 or later, the cluster's kube-dns server is automatically replaced with the CoreDNS server. Note that if you customized kube-dns behavior using the original kube-dns ConfigMap, those customizations are not carried forward to the CoreDNS ConfigMap. You will have to create and apply a new ConfigMap containing the customizations to override settings in the CoreDNS Corefile. For more information about upgrading to CoreDNS, see Configuring DNS Servers for Kubernetes Clusters.\n\n"

        "text": "oracle cloud infrastructure, oci, Preparing for Container Engine for Kubernetes service, \n \nBefore you can use  Container Engine for Kubernetes to create a Kubernetes cluster:\n\nYou must have access to an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure tenancy. The tenancy must be subscribed to one or more of the regions in which Container Engine for Kubernetes is available (see Availability by Region).\n\nYour tenancy must have sufficient quota on different types of resource (see Service Limits). More specifically:\n\nCompute instance quota:\u00c2\u00a0To create a Kubernetes cluster, at least one compute instance (node)\u00c2\u00a0must be available in the tenancy. However, you'll probably want more than this minimum. For example, to create a highly available cluster in a region with three availability domains (ADs), at least three compute instances must be available (one in each availability domain).\nBlock volume quota: If you intend to create Kubernetes persistent volumes, sufficient block volume quota must be available in each availability domain to meet the persistent volume claim. Persistent volume claims must request a minimum of 50 gigabytes. See Setting Up Storage for Kubernetes Clusters.\nLoad balancer quota: If you intend to create a load balancer to distribute traffic between the nodes running a service in a Kubernetes cluster, sufficient load balancer quota must be available in the region. See  Defining Kubernetes Services of Type LoadBalancer.\n\nWithin your tenancy, there must already be a compartment to contain the necessary network resources (such as a VCN, subnets, internet gateway, route table, security lists). If such a compartment does not exist already, you will have to create it. Note that the network resources can reside in the root compartment. However, if you expect multiple teams to create clusters, best practice is to create a separate compartment  for each team. \n\nWithin the compartment, network resources (such as a VCN, subnets, internet gateway, route table, security lists) must be appropriately configured in each region in which you want to create and deploy clusters.\nFor example, to create a highly available cluster in a region with three availability domains, the VCN must include:\n\nFor worker nodes: a regional subnet (recommended), or three AD-specific subnets (one in each of the availability domains).\nFor load balancers: optionally (but usually) an additional regional subnet (recommended), or an additional two AD-specific subnets (each in a different availability domain).\nBest practice is to use regional subnets to make failover across availability domains simpler to implement. \nWhen creating a new cluster, you can have Container Engine for Kubernetes automatically create and configure new network resources for the new cluster, or you can  specify existing network resources. If you specify existing network resources, you or somebody else must have already configured those resources appropriately. See Network Resource Configuration for Cluster Creation and Deployment.\n\n\nTo create and/or manage clusters, you must belong to one of the following:\n\nThe tenancy's Administrators group\n\nA group to which a policy grants the appropriate Container Engine for Kubernetes permissions. See Create Required Policy for Groups.\n\n\n\nTo perform Kubernetes operations on a cluster:\n\nYou must be able to run the Kubernetes command line tool kubectl. You can use the kubectl installation included in Cloud Shell, or you can use a local installation of kubectl (see Accessing a Cluster Using Kubectl).\nYou must have set up your own copy of the cluster's kubeconfig configuration file  (see Setting Up Cluster Access). Note that  you must set up your own kubeconfig file. You cannot access a cluster using a kubeconfig file that a different user set up.\nYou must have appropriate permissions to access the cluster (see About Access Control and Container Engine for Kubernetes).\n\n\n"

This storage is persistent from session to session, but after 6-months of non-use, the administrator for your tenancy will receive a notification that the storage will be removed in 60 days. Starting a cloud shell session resets the storage removal timer.\nCloud Shell does not support mounting additional storage.\nCloud Shell does not scan user files for malware or viruses.\nCloud Shell sessions do not allow for any incoming connections, and there is no\n                public IP address available.\nThe OCI CLI will execute commands against the region selected in the Console's Region selection menu when the Cloud Shell was started. Changing the region selection in the console will not change the region for existing Cloud Shell instances; you will need to open a new Cloud Shell instance to change regions.\nCloud Shell sessions have a maximum length of 24 hours, and time out after 60\n                minutes of inactivity.\n\nCloud Shell uses websockets to communicate between your browser and the service.\n                    If your browser has websockets disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has\n                    websockets disabled you will see an error message (\"An unexpected error\n                    occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud Shell from the console.\n\nCloud Shell is designed for interactive use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Users who need additional storage for Cloud Shell or want to run non-interactive long-running tasks are encouraged to use Compute and Storage resources in their tenancy.\nFor maximum compatibility, Cloud Shell includes Python version 2 and Python version\n                3. Python 2 is the default that will run when you enter 'python' at the command\n                line. To run Python 3, enter 'python3' at the command line.\nThe following reserved words can't be used as the user name for a Cloud Shell user: oci, root, bin, daemon, adm, lp, sync, shutdown, halt, mai, operator, games, ftp, nobody, oci, systemd-network, dbus, polkitd, tss, and apache. Attempting to create a Cloud Shell session when logged in with a user name (or the part of the name before the @ sign if the user name is an email address)\u00c2\u00a0that is one of these reserved words will result in an \"Unexpected Error\" message.\nEntirely numerical user names (for example, \"1234\")\u00c2\u00a0are not supported by Cloud Shell.\nThe Cloud Shell session time zone is UTC, and cannot be changed.\nCloud Shell does not allow root access or the use of sudo, so packages that require\n                root access for installation can't be installed. Many packages are available in\n                versions that do not require root for installation; you can unpack and install these\n                in your home directory. \nCloud Shell does not allow the use of ping, since ping requires root access.\nCloud Shell boots in FIPS mode, which might affect the behavior of some commands.\nCloud Shell cannot generate PKCS#1 keys when using the openssl command, because Cloud Shell boots in FIPS mode. FIPS mode requires that Cloud Shell generates PKCS#8 keys.\nFor more information on Cloud Shell limits, see the Cloud Shell section in Service Limits. \n\nCloud Shell Access and Other Restrictions\nYou can access OCI resources from Cloud Shell according to the policies granted by\n                your tenancy administrator.

        "text": "oracle cloud infrastructure, oci, About Access Control and Container Engine for Kubernetes service, \n \nTo perform operations on a Kubernetes cluster, you must have appropriate permissions to access the cluster.\nFor most operations on Kubernetes clusters created and managed by Container Engine for Kubernetes, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Identity and Access Management (IAM) provides access control. A user's permissions to access clusters comes from the groups to which they belong. The permissions for a group are defined by policies. Policies define what actions members of a group can perform, and in which compartments. Users can then access clusters and perform operations based on the policies set for the groups they are members of. \nIAM provides control over:\n\nwhether a user can create or delete clusters\nwhether a user can add, remove, or modify node pools\nwhich Kubernetes object create/delete/view operations a user can perform on all clusters within a compartment or tenancy\n\nSee Policy Configuration for Cluster Creation and Deployment.\nIn addition to IAM, the Kubernetes RBAC Authorizer\n            can enforce additional fine-grained access control for users on specific clusters via\n            Kubernetes RBAC roles and clusterroles. A Kubernetes RBAC role is a collection of\n            permissions. For example, a role might include read permission on pods and list\n            permission for pods. A Kubernetes RBAC clusterrole is just like a role, but can be used\n            anywhere in the cluster. A Kubernetes RBAC rolebinding maps a role to a user or group,\n            granting that role's permissions to the user or group for resources in that namespace.\n            Similarly, a Kubernetes RBAC clusterrolebinding maps a clusterrole to a user or group,\n            granting that clusterrole's permissions to the user or group across the entire\n            cluster.\nIAM and the Kubernetes RBAC Authorizer work together\n            to enable users who have been successfully authorized by at least one of them to\n            complete the requested Kubernetes operation. You can use OCIDs to map Kubernetes RBAC\n            rolebindings and clusterrolebindings to IAM users and groups.\nWhen a user attempts to perform any operation on a cluster (except for create role and\n            create clusterrole operations), IAM first\n            determines whether the group to which the user belongs has the appropriate and\n            sufficient permissions. If so, the operation succeeds. If the attempted operation also\n            requires additional permissions granted via a Kubernetes RBAC role or clusterrole, the\n            Kubernetes RBAC Authorizer then determines whether the user or group has been granted\n            the appropriate Kubernetes role or clusterrole. \nTypically, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll want to define your own Kubernetes RBAC roles and clusterroles when deploying a Kubernetes cluster  to provide additional fine-grained control. When you attempt to perform a create role or create clusterrole operation, the Kubernetes RBAC Authorizer first determines whether you have sufficient Kubernetes privileges. To create a role or clusterrole, you must have been assigned an existing Kubernetes RBAC role (or clusterrole) that has at least the same or higher privileges as the new role (or clusterrole) you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re attempting to create.\nBy default, users are not assigned any Kubernetes RBAC roles (or clusterroles) by default. So before attempting to create a new role (or clusterrole), you must be assigned an appropriately privileged role (or clusterrole). A number of such roles and clusterroles are always created by default, including the cluster-admin clusterrole (for a full list, see Default Roles and Role Bindings in the Kubernetes documentation). The cluster-admin clusterrole essentially confers super-user privileges. A user granted the cluster-admin clusterrole can perform any operation across all namespaces in a given cluster. \nNote that Oracle Cloud Infrastructure tenancy administrators already have sufficient privileges, and do not require the cluster-admin clusterrole.\n"

However, you don't have to change any of your existing Docker images because Docker images are Open Container Initiative (OCI) compliant. As far as Kubernetes is concerned, all OCI-compliant images look the same.\nNote the following:\n\nCRI-O is an implementation of the Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface (CRI), which enables the use of OCI-compatible runtimes. CRI-O can pull your existing Docker images and run them on your Kubernetes version 1.20.8 clusters.\nWhen using the Docker runtime, the default configuration captures the standard output and standard error streams of containers using the JSON format. In contrast, CRI-O uses the Logrus format. If you use a logging tool such as Fluentd or Fluent Bit, update the tool's configuration to use a new parser to parse CRI logs. For example:\nIf you use Fluentd, use the fluent-plugin-parser-cri parser.\nIf you use Fluent Bit, use the Container Runtime Interface (CRI) parser.\n\nYou might have a workflow in a cluster that relies on the underlying docker socket /var/run/docker.sock (a pattern often referred to as Docker in Docker). Starting with Kubernetes version 1.20.8, such a workflow no longer functions.\nIf you previously used the Docker CLI to run commands on a host, you have to use crictl (a CLI for CRI-compatible container runtimes) instead. \nThe upstream Kubernetes project is deprecating Docker as a container runtime after Kubernetes version 1.20.\n\nTo find out more:\n\nSee the Kubernetes 1.20.8 Changelog for more information about Kubernetes 1.20.8\nSee the Dockershim Deprecation FAQ for more information about the deprecation of the dockershim adapter (which previously enabled the kubelet to interact with Docker as if Docker were a CRI-compatible runtime)\n\n\n"

        "text": "oracle cloud infrastructure, oci, Viewing Work Requests service, \n \nMany Container Engine for Kubernetes service requests do not take effect\n            immediately. For example, the creation of a node pool isn't completed until all required\n            instances are active. In these cases, the request is fulfilled asynchronously, and its\n            progress tracked by an associated work request. A work request is an activity log that\n            provides visibility into in-progress asynchronous operations, enabling you to track each\n            step in the operation's progress. Each work request has an OCID that allows you to\n            interact with it programmatically and use it for automation. \nWork requests include information about the time the request started and finished. If an\n            operation fails, a work request can help you determine which step of the process had an\n            error. Some operations affect multiple resources. For example, creating a node pool also\n            affects instances. A work request provides a list of the resources that an operation\n            affects.\nFor more information, see Work Requests\n            and the Work Requests API.\nNode Pool Work Requests\nResources managed by Container Engine for Kubernetes can only\n                support one work request at a time.

        "text": "oracle cloud infrastructure, oci, Setting Up Cluster Access service, \n Notes about Kubeconfig Files, \nNote the following about kubeconfig files:\n\nA single kubeconfig file can include the details for multiple clusters, as multiple contexts. The cluster on which operations will be performed is specified by the  current-context: element in the kubeconfig file. \nA kubeconfig file includes an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure CLI command that dynamically generates an authentication token and inserts it when you run a kubectl command. The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure CLI must be available on your shell's executable path (for example, $PATH on Linux).\nThe authentication tokens generated by the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure CLI command in the kubeconfig file are  short-lived, cluster-scoped, and specific to individual users. As a result, you cannot share kubeconfig files between users to access Kubernetes clusters.\n\nThe Oracle Cloud Infrastructure CLI command in the kubeconfig file uses your current CLI profile when generating an authentication token. If you have defined multiple profiles in different tenancies in the CLI\u00c2\u00a0configuration file (for example, in ~/.oci/config), specify which profile to use when generating the authentication token as follows. In both cases, <profile-name> is the name of the profile defined in the CLI\u00c2\u00a0configuration file:\n\n\nAdd  --profile to the args: section of the kubeconfig file as follows:user:\n  exec:\n    apiVersion: client.authentication.k8s.io/v1beta1\n    args:\n    - ce\n    - cluster\n    - generate-token\n    - --cluster-id\n    - <cluster ocid>\n    - --profile\n    - <profile-name>\n    command: oci\n    env: []\n\n\nSet the OCI_CLI_PROFILE environment variable to the name of the profile defined in the CLI\u00c2\u00a0configuration file before running kubectl commands. For example:\n\nexport OCI_CLI_PROFILE=<profile-name>\nkubectl get nodes\n\n\n\nThe  authentication tokens generated by the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure CLI command in the kubeconfig file are appropriate to authenticate individual users accessing the cluster using kubectl. However, the generated authentication tokens are unsuitable if you want other processes and tools to access the cluster, such as continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) tools. In this case, consider creating a Kubernetes service account and adding its associated authentication token to the kubeconfig file. For more information, see Adding a Service Account Authentication Token to a Kubeconfig File.\n\nAn IAM policy might have been defined to restrict cluster access to only users that have been verified with multi-factor authentication (MFA). If such a policy exists, you have to add --profile and --auth arguments to the kubeconfig file to enable an MFA-verified user to access the cluster using kubectl, as follows. In both cases, <profile-name> is the name of the MFA-verified user's profile defined in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure CLI configuration file:\n\n\nAdd the following arguments to the args: section of the kubeconfig file:\n\n    - --profile\n    - <profile-name>\n    - --auth\n    - security_token\nFor example:\nuser:\n  exec:\n    apiVersion: client.authentication.k8s.io/v1beta1\n    args:\n    - ce\n    - cluster\n    - generate-token\n    - --cluster-id\n    - <cluster ocid>\n    - --profile\n    - <profile-name>\n    - --auth\n    - security_token\n    command: oci\n    env: []\n\n\nSet the OCI_CLI_PROFILE environment variable to the name of the MFA-verified user's profile defined in the CLI\u00c2\u00a0configuration file before running kubectl commands. For example:\n\nexport OCI_CLI_PROFILE=<profile-name>\n\nkubectl get nodes\n\n\n\nAfter updating the kubeconfig file, the user you use to access the cluster must be MFA-verified. If you attempt to access the cluster using a user that has not been MFA-verified, the message error: You must be logged in to the server (Unauthorized) is displayed.\nFor more information about MFA-verified users, see Managing Multi-Factor Authentication.\n\n\n"

You can do this in a number of ways:\n\nUsing kubectl. If you haven't already done so, follow the steps to set up the cluster's kubeconfig configuration file and (if necessary) set the KUBECONFIG environment variable to point to the file.  Note that  you must set up your own kubeconfig file. You cannot access a cluster using a kubeconfig file that a different user set up. See Setting Up Cluster Access. Then in a terminal window, enter kubectl get nodes to see the public IP addresses of worker nodes in node pools in the cluster.\nUsing the Console. In the Console, display the Cluster List page and then select the cluster to which the worker node belongs. On the Node Pools tab, click the name of the node pool to which the worker node belongs. On the Nodes tab, you see the public IP address of every worker node in the node pool.\nUsing the REST API. Use the ListNodePools operation to see the public IP addresses of worker nodes in a node pool.\n\n\nIn the terminal window, enter ssh opc@<node_ip_address> to connect to the worker node, where <node_ip_address> is the IP address of the worker node that you made a note of earlier. For example, you might enter ssh opc@192.0.2.254.\nNote that if the SSH private key is not stored in the file or in the path that the ssh utility expects (for example, the ssh utility might expect the private key to be stored in ~/.ssh/id_rsa), you must explicitly specify the private key filename and location in one of two ways:\n\nUse the -i option to specify the filename and location of the private key. For example, ssh -i ~/.ssh/my_keys/my_host_key_filename opc@192.0.2.254\n\nAdd the private key filename and location to an SSH configuration file, either the client configuration file (~/.ssh/config) if it exists, or the system-wide client configuration file (/etc/ssh/ssh_config). For example, you might add the following:Host 192.0.2.254 IdentityFile ~/.ssh/my_keys/my_host_key_filename\n\nFor more about the ssh utility\u00e2\u0080\u0099s configuration file, enter man ssh_config\nNote also that permissions on the private key file must allow you read/write/execute access, but prevent other users from accessing the file. For example, to set appropriate permissions, you might enter chmod 600 ~/.ssh/my_keys/my_host_key_filename. If permissions are not set correctly and the private key file is accessible to other users, the ssh utility will simply ignore the private key file.\n\n\n"

Etcd is an open source distributed key-value store that Kubernetes uses for cluster coordination and state management. In the Kubernetes clusters created by Container Engine for Kubernetes, etcd writes and reads data to and from block storage volumes in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Block Volume service. By default, Oracle encrypts data in block volumes at rest, including etcd and Kubernetes secrets. Oracle manages this default encryption using a master encryption key, without requiring any action on your part. For additional control over the lifecycle of the master encryption key and how it is used, you can choose to manage the master encryption key yourself, rather than have Oracle manage it for you. \nIf you choose to manage the master encryption key yourself, you specify the key to use, and you have control over when the key is rotated. The master encryption key is stored in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure\nVault service (see Overview of Vault). The Kubernetes secrets at rest in etcd are encrypted using a data encryption key (a DEK) using the AES-CBC encryption algorithm with PKCS#7 padding. A new DEK is generated for each encryption. The data encryption keys are encrypted using the master encryption key (the MEK), a concept known as envelope encryption. \nBefore you can create a cluster for which you want to manage the master encryption key yourself, you have to:\n\ncreate a suitable master encryption key in Vault (or obtain the name and OCID of such a key)\ncreate a dynamic group that includes all clusters in the compartment in which you are going to create the new cluster\ncreate a policy authorizing the dynamic group to use the master encryption key\n\nHaving created the cluster and specified that you want to manage the master encryption key yourself, you can optionally restrict the use of the master encryption key by modifying the dynamic group to include just that cluster.\nNote the following:\n\nYou can only select the option to manage the master encryption key yourself when creating a new cluster in the 'Custom Create' workflow. You cannot choose to manage the master encryption key when creating a new cluster in the 'Quick Create' workflow. And you cannot choose to manage the master encryption keys for clusters you previously created in the 'Custom Create' workflow.\n\n Caution\nIf you select the option to manage the master encryption key yourself, do not subsequently delete the master encryption key in the Vault service. As soon as you schedule a key for deletion in Vault, the Kubernetes secrets stored for the cluster in etcd become inaccessible. If you have already scheduled the key for deletion, it might still be in the Pending Deletion state. If that is the case, cancel the scheduled key deletion (see Cancelling Key Deletion) to restore access to the Kubernetes secrets. If you allow the scheduled key deletion operation to complete and the master encryption key to be deleted, the Kubernetes secrets stored for the cluster in etcd are permanently inaccessible. As a result, cluster upgrades will fail. In this situation, you have no choice but to delete and recreate the cluster. \n\n"

This access is required whether\n            you're using the Console or the REST API with an SDK,\n            CLI, or other tool. If you get a message that you don't have permission or are\n            unauthorized, verify with your administrator what type of access you have and which\n                compartment\u00c2\u00a0 you should work in.\nFor some operations, the Certificates service also\n            requires resources to have security access not granted by policies that cover users or\n            groups. This section describes how to authorize users as well as resources that must act\n            on other resources.\nStep 1: Create a Dynamic Group\nBefore you configure a policy for working with CAs, you must first create a dynamic\n                group with the following matching\n                rule:resource.type='certificateauthority'\nThis matching rule defines a dynamic group that includes all CAs as members. You need\n                this dynamic group in order to authorize CAs to make API calls against other\n                services, as needed. CAs typically need permission to access Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vault and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage resources. For more information\n                about dynamic groups, see Managing Dynamic Groups.\n\nStep 2: Create a Policy for the Dynamic Group\nAfter creating the dynamic group, you create a policy for the dynamic group. In the\n                following policy, the dynamic group has the example name CertificateAuthority-DG.\n                The policy gives members of the dynamic group permission to use Vault keys and to do anything with Object Storage objects in the specified example\n                compartments. This type of policy is referred to as a resource principal policy\n                because it authorizes a resource as a principal actor that can act on other\n                resources.\nAllow dynamic-group CertificateAuthority-DG to use keys in compartment DEF\nAllow dynamic-group CertificateAuthority-DG to manage objects in compartment XYZ\n\nStep 3: Add a Policy for Administrators\nYou also need a policy to authorize administrators to access resources. The following\n                policy gives permission to the example group CertificateAuthorityAdmins to do\n                anything with any resources included in the aggregate resource-type\n                    certificate-authority-family and to work with required Vault and Object Storage resources in the specified example compartments, as needed. This includes the\n                permissions needed to specify the encryption key for the CA.\nAllow group CertificateAuthorityAdmins to manage certificate-authority-family in compartment ABC\nAllow group CertificateAuthorityAdmins to read keys in compartment DEF\nAllow group CertificateAuthorityAdmins to use key-delegate in compartment DEF\nAllow group CertificateAuthorityAdmins to read buckets in compartment XYZ\nAllow group CertificateAuthorityAdmins to read vaults in compartment DEF\nTogether, these statements provide the minimum access needed to complete\n                administrative tasks with certificate authorities, as described later in this topic.\n                For more information about permissions or if you need to write less restrictive\n                policies, see Details for the Certificates Service.

        "text": "oracle cloud infrastructure, oci, Overview of Certificates service, \n Certificates Concepts, Understand key concepts and components of the Certificates service.\n\n\nCERTIFICATES\nA certificate is a digital document that confirms its subject is the owner of\n                    the public key in the certificate. A certificate is also known as an end-entity\n                    or leaf certificate. An end-entity certificate is any certificate that cannot be\n                    used to sign other certificates. For instance, TLS/SSL server and client\n                    certificates, email certificates, code signing certificates, and qualified\n                    certificates are all end-entity certificates.\nCERTIFICATE AUTHORITIES\nA certificate authority (CA) issues certificates and subordinate CAs. CAs exist\n                    to certify the ownership of a public key in a given certificate. A CA\n                    certificate authenticates the CA signature on the certificates that the CA\n                    issues. CAs exist in a hierarchy where the CA at the top is known as the root CA\n                    and any CA that exists within the hierarchy is a subordinate CA.\nA CA hierarchy establishes a chain of trust (or certification path) in which\n                    each entity signs the entity below it in the chain. The root CA is self-signed.\n                    For a certificate to be trusted, the root CA must be a trusted root CA according\n                    to the endpoint performing the validation.\nCA BUNDLES\nA bundle includes the root and intermediate certificates (also known as the\n                    contents of the bundle), the properties of the certificate (and certificate\n                    version), and user-provided contextual metadata for the certificate.\n                    A CA bundle\n                    can include a single CA or multiple CAs, including those not managed by the Certificates service. The Certificates service supports certificate\n                    content in PEM format.\nCERTIFICATE CHAINS\nA certificate chain is the list of certificates from the end-entity certificate\n                    to the root certificate. The service does not support mixed certificate chains\n                    in which certificates use different key algorithm families, such as using RSA\n                    keys in some certificates and ECDSA keys in others. We recommend using different\n                    CA chains for different key algorithm families.\nCERTIFICATE REVOCATION LISTS\nA certificate revocation list (CRL) is issued by a CA and contains all CAs and\n                    certificates that the issuing CA has revoked prior to their expiration dates.\n                    Revocation invalidates a certificate so it can no longer be trusted.\n\n"

        "text": "oracle cloud infrastructure, oci, Overview of Certificates service, \n Certificates Concepts, Understand key concepts and components of the Certificates service.\n\n\nCERTIFICATES\nA certificate is a digital document that confirms its subject is the owner of\n                    the public key in the certificate. A certificate is also known as an end-entity\n                    or leaf certificate. An end-entity certificate is any certificate that cannot be\n                    used to sign other certificates. For instance, TLS/SSL server and client\n                    certificates, email certificates, code signing certificates, and qualified\n                    certificates are all end-entity certificates.\nCERTIFICATE AUTHORITIES\nA certificate authority (CA) issues certificates and subordinate CAs. CAs exist\n                    to certify the ownership of a public key in a given certificate. A CA\n                    certificate authenticates the CA signature on the certificates that the CA\n                    issues. CAs exist in a hierarchy where the CA at the top is known as the root CA\n                    and any CA that exists within the hierarchy is a subordinate CA.\nA CA hierarchy establishes a chain of trust (or certification path) in which\n                    each entity signs the entity below it in the chain. The root CA is self-signed.\n                    For a certificate to be trusted, the root CA must be a trusted root CA according\n                    to the endpoint performing the validation.\nCA BUNDLES\nA bundle includes the root and intermediate certificates (also known as the\n                    contents of the bundle), the properties of the certificate (and certificate\n                    version), and user-provided contextual metadata for the certificate.\n                    A CA bundle\n                    can include a single CA or multiple CAs, including those not managed by the Certificates service. The Certificates service supports certificate\n                    content in PEM format.\nCERTIFICATE CHAINS\nA certificate chain is the list of certificates from the end-entity certificate\n                    to the root certificate. The service does not support mixed certificate chains\n                    in which certificates use different key algorithm families, such as using RSA\n                    keys in some certificates and ECDSA keys in others. We recommend using different\n                    CA chains for different key algorithm families.\nCERTIFICATE REVOCATION LISTS\nA certificate revocation list (CRL) is issued by a CA and contains all CAs and\n                    certificates that the issuing CA has revoked prior to their expiration dates.\n                    Revocation invalidates a certificate so it can no longer be trusted.\n\n"

        "text": "oracle cloud infrastructure, oci, Cloud Shell service, \n Cloud Shell Limitations, \nKeep the following limitations in mind when using Cloud Shell:\n\nCloud Shell comes with 5GB\u00c2\u00a0of storage for the VM's home directory. This storage is persistent from session to session, but after 6-months of non-use, the administrator for your tenancy will receive a notification that the storage will be removed in 60 days. Starting a cloud shell session resets the storage removal timer.\nCloud Shell does not support mounting additional storage.\nCloud Shell does not scan user files for malware or viruses.\nCloud Shell sessions do not allow for any incoming connections, and there is no\n                public IP address available.\nThe OCI CLI will execute commands against the region selected in the Console's Region selection menu when the Cloud Shell was started. Changing the region selection in the console will not change the region for existing Cloud Shell instances; you will need to open a new Cloud Shell instance to change regions.\nCloud Shell sessions have a maximum length of 24 hours, and time out after 60\n                minutes of inactivity.\n\nCloud Shell uses websockets to communicate between your browser and the service.\n                    If your browser has websockets disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has\n                    websockets disabled you will see an error message (\"An unexpected error\n                    occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud Shell from the console.\n\nCloud Shell is designed for interactive use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Users who need additional storage for Cloud Shell or want to run non-interactive long-running tasks are encouraged to use Compute and Storage resources in their tenancy.\nFor maximum compatibility, Cloud Shell includes Python version 2 and Python version\n                3. Python 2 is the default that will run when you enter 'python' at the command\n                line. To run Python 3, enter 'python3' at the command line.\nThe following reserved words can't be used as the user name for a Cloud Shell user: oci, root, bin, daemon, adm, lp, sync, shutdown, halt, mai, operator, games, ftp, nobody, oci, systemd-network, dbus, polkitd, tss, and apache. Attempting to create a Cloud Shell session when logged in with a user name (or the part of the name before the @ sign if the user name is an email address)\u00c2\u00a0that is one of these reserved words will result in an \"Unexpected Error\" message.\nEntirely numerical user names (for example, \"1234\")\u00c2\u00a0are not supported by Cloud Shell.\nThe Cloud Shell session time zone is UTC, and cannot be changed.\nCloud Shell does not allow root access or the use of sudo, so packages that require\n                root access for installation can't be installed. Many packages are available in\n                versions that do not require root for installation; you can unpack and install these\n                in your home directory. \nCloud Shell does not allow the use of ping, since ping requires root access.\nCloud Shell boots in FIPS mode, which might affect the behavior of some commands.\nCloud Shell cannot generate PKCS#1 keys when using the openssl command, because Cloud Shell boots in FIPS mode. FIPS mode requires that Cloud Shell generates PKCS#8 keys.\nFor more information on Cloud Shell limits, see the Cloud Shell section in Service Limits. \n\nCloud Shell Access and Other Restrictions\nYou can access OCI resources from Cloud Shell according to the policies granted by\n                your tenancy administrator. There is no additional access because you're using Cloud\n                Shell, and Cloud Shell does not provide any additional access to your tenancy, or\n                private resources in your tenancy VCNs. Note Cloud Shell uses websockets to\n                    communicate between your browser and the service. If your browser has websockets\n                    disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has websockets disabled you will see an\n                    error message (\"An unexpected error occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud\n                    Shell from the console.\nWhile Cloud Shell provides access to the internet, there is no ingress from the\n                outside world into Cloud Shell (for example: you cannot ssh in to Cloud Shell) and\n                no public IP address available. If your tenancy admin does not want to enable access\n                to the internet from OCI, they should not grant access to Cloud Shell with an IAM\n                policy.\n\n"

        "text": "oracle cloud infrastructure, oci, Cloud Shell service, \n Cloud Shell Limitations, \nKeep the following limitations in mind when using Cloud Shell:\n\nCloud Shell comes with 5GB\u00c2\u00a0of storage for the VM's home directory. This storage is persistent from session to session, but after 6-months of non-use, the administrator for your tenancy will receive a notification that the storage will be removed in 60 days. Starting a cloud shell session resets the storage removal timer.\nCloud Shell does not support mounting additional storage.\nCloud Shell does not scan user files for malware or viruses.\nCloud Shell sessions do not allow for any incoming connections, and there is no\n                public IP address available.\nThe OCI CLI will execute commands against the region selected in the Console's Region selection menu when the Cloud Shell was started. Changing the region selection in the console will not change the region for existing Cloud Shell instances; you will need to open a new Cloud Shell instance to change regions.\nCloud Shell sessions have a maximum length of 24 hours, and time out after 60\n                minutes of inactivity.\n\nCloud Shell uses websockets to communicate between your browser and the service.\n                    If your browser has websockets disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has\n                    websockets disabled you will see an error message (\"An unexpected error\n                    occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud Shell from the console.\n\nCloud Shell is designed for interactive use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Users who need additional storage for Cloud Shell or want to run non-interactive long-running tasks are encouraged to use Compute and Storage resources in their tenancy.\nFor maximum compatibility, Cloud Shell includes Python version 2 and Python version\n                3. Python 2 is the default that will run when you enter 'python' at the command\n                line. To run Python 3, enter 'python3' at the command line.\nThe following reserved words can't be used as the user name for a Cloud Shell user: oci, root, bin, daemon, adm, lp, sync, shutdown, halt, mai, operator, games, ftp, nobody, oci, systemd-network, dbus, polkitd, tss, and apache. Attempting to create a Cloud Shell session when logged in with a user name (or the part of the name before the @ sign if the user name is an email address)\u00c2\u00a0that is one of these reserved words will result in an \"Unexpected Error\" message.\nEntirely numerical user names (for example, \"1234\")\u00c2\u00a0are not supported by Cloud Shell.\nThe Cloud Shell session time zone is UTC, and cannot be changed.\nCloud Shell does not allow root access or the use of sudo, so packages that require\n                root access for installation can't be installed. Many packages are available in\n                versions that do not require root for installation; you can unpack and install these\n                in your home directory. \nCloud Shell does not allow the use of ping, since ping requires root access.\nCloud Shell boots in FIPS mode, which might affect the behavior of some commands.\nCloud Shell cannot generate PKCS#1 keys when using the openssl command, because Cloud Shell boots in FIPS mode. FIPS mode requires that Cloud Shell generates PKCS#8 keys.\nFor more information on Cloud Shell limits, see the Cloud Shell section in Service Limits. \n\nCloud Shell Access and Other Restrictions\nYou can access OCI resources from Cloud Shell according to the policies granted by\n                your tenancy administrator. There is no additional access because you're using Cloud\n                Shell, and Cloud Shell does not provide any additional access to your tenancy, or\n                private resources in your tenancy VCNs. Note Cloud Shell uses websockets to\n                    communicate between your browser and the service. If your browser has websockets\n                    disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has websockets disabled you will see an\n                    error message (\"An unexpected error occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud\n                    Shell from the console.\nWhile Cloud Shell provides access to the internet, there is no ingress from the\n                outside world into Cloud Shell (for example: you cannot ssh in to Cloud Shell) and\n                no public IP address available.

        "text": "oracle cloud infrastructure, oci, Overview of Streaming service, \n How Streaming Works, \nHere's how Streaming works:\nA producer publishes messages to a stream, which is an append-only\n            log. These messages are distributed among Oracle-managed partitions for\n            scalability.\nPartitions allow you to distribute a stream by splitting messages across multiple nodes\n            (or brokers). Each partition can be placed on a separate machine, allowing multiple\n            consumers to read a stream in parallel.\nA\u00c2\u00a0consumer reads messages from one or more partitions. Consumers can read from any\n            partition regardless of where the partition is hosted. Each message within a stream is\n            marked with an offset value, so a consumer can pick up where it left off if it is\n            interrupted. Messages from a partition are guaranteed to be delivered in the same order\n            they were produced.\nConsumers can read messages explicitly by providing the partition and offset, or as a member of a consumer group, which coordinates the consumption of an entire stream by the members of the group.

Partitions allow you to\n                    distribute a stream by splitting messages across multiple nodes. This also\n                    allows multiple consumers to read from a stream in parallel.\ncursor\n\nA pointer to a location in a stream. This location could be a pointer to a\n                        specific offset or time in a partition, or to a group's current\n                        location.\n\nmessage\nA Base64-encoded message that is published to a\n                    stream. Streaming is schema-agnostic and accepts\n                    any message format, including XML, JSON, CSV, and even compressed formats such\n                    as gzip. Producers and consumers should agree upon the message format.\nproducer\nAn entity that publishes messages to a stream.\nconsumer\nAn entity that reads messages from one or more streams.\nconsumer group\nA set of instances which coordinate to consume\n                    messages from all partitions in a stream. At any given time, the messages from a\n                    specific partition can only be consumed by a single consumer in the group.\ninstance\nA member of a consumer group. Instances are defined\n                    when a group cursor is created. Group membership is maintained through\n                    interaction; lack of interaction results in a timeout, removing the instance\n                    from the consumer group.\nkey\nAn identifier used to group related messages. \noffset\nThe location of a message within a partition. Each\n                    message within the partition is identified by its offset. Consumers can read\n                    messages starting from any chosen offset. You can use the offset to restart\n                    reading from a stream if interrupted.\n\n"

Messages in a stream are immutable\n                    and available for the entirety of the stream's configured retention time.\nReplay\nBecause a stream's messages are not removed immediately when processed by\n                    consumers, you can replay any and all messages in the stream at any time within\n                    the configured retention limit.\nMessage guarantees\nEach message is guaranteed to be delivered at least once. In some cases, such as\n                    a consumer's failure to commit messages before going offline, messages may be\n                    delivered multiple times. \nOrder guarantees\nMessages within a stream, per partition, are always delivered in the same order\n                    that they were produced.\nClient-side cursors\nYour client applications control and track which messages are read and can\n                        move the cursor as needed for maximum flexibility.\nHorizontal scale\nPartitions provide an opportunity to scale up throughput to meet the needs of\n                    multiple consumers, resulting in increased flexibility.\nConsumer groups\nConsumer groups handle all of the coordination that is required to deliver\n                    messages to multiple consumers in a balanced manner. Because this management is\n                    handled by a consumer group on behalf of all of its members, you can enjoy\n                    reduced overhead and operational ease.\n\n"

If you do not want to delete your streams, contact the Streaming team so we can rename your streams without\n                data loss.\n\nLoad Balancing Connection Recycling\nBecause the Kafka protocol uses long-lived TCP connections, the Streaming Kafka compatibility layer implements a\n                load balancing mechanism to periodically balance connections between front-end\n                nodes. This mechanism periodically closes connections to force new ones. Most Kafka\n                SDKs handle these disconnections automatically when consuming, but producing to Streaming using the Kafka API\u00c2\u00a0might raise\n                disconnection errors. Disconnections can be mitigated by adding retries to your\n                requests. Retries are part of the Kafka SDK and are automatically enabled, and you\n                can explicitly configure their behavior.\n\n"

Keep additional Streaming limits in mind when making your\n            design decisions.\n Tip\nTo help you manage application spikes, we recommend allocating partitions slightly\n                higher than your maximum throughput.\n\n"

If there is more than one partition,\n            the partition where the message is published is calculated using the message's key.\nFor more information, see Publishing Messages.\nKey to partition mapping\nMessages with the same key go to the same partition. Messages with different keys\n                might go to different partitions or to the same partition. If you do not specify a\n                key, Streaming recognizes the null key and\n                generates a random key on the behalf of the user. If a user publishes the same\n                message twice, it could go to different partitions, since a completely new key is\n                generated. Do not expect all messages with a null key to go to the same\n                partition.\nBy default, Streaming provides uniform and\n                predictable distribution of messages to a stream's partitions. Streaming APIs do not let you specify exactly which\n                partition data is published to, since this can introduce a risk of hotspotting a\n                single partition if a user is not aware of the nuances of Streaming. However, if you use Kafka APIs to\n                interact with Streaming, you may choose to do custom\n                partitioning and explicitly map messages to partitions, although we do not recommend\n                it.\n\nEffective partitioning keys\nTo ensure uniform distribution of messages, you need effective values for your\n                message keys. To create an effective value, consider the selectivity and cardinality\n                of your Streaming data.\nCardinality: Consider the total number of unique keys that could potentially\n                be generated based on the specific use case. Higher key cardinality generally means\n                better distribution.\nSelectivity: Consider the number of messages with each key. Higher selectivity\n                means more messages per key, which can lead to hotspots.\nAlways aim for high cardinality and low selectivity.\n\nOrdering\nMessages with the same key are guaranteed to be stored in the order they are\n                published, and delivered to consumers in the same order they were produced. Because\n                messages with the same key go to the same partition, this guarantee only applies at\n                the partition level.\n\n"

        "text": "oracle cloud infrastructure, oci, Cloud Shell service, \n Cloud Shell Limitations, \nKeep the following limitations in mind when using Cloud Shell:\n\nCloud Shell comes with 5GB\u00c2\u00a0of storage for the VM's home directory. This storage is persistent from session to session, but after 6-months of non-use, the administrator for your tenancy will receive a notification that the storage will be removed in 60 days. Starting a cloud shell session resets the storage removal timer.\nCloud Shell does not support mounting additional storage.\nCloud Shell does not scan user files for malware or viruses.\nCloud Shell sessions do not allow for any incoming connections, and there is no\n                public IP address available.\nThe OCI CLI will execute commands against the region selected in the Console's Region selection menu when the Cloud Shell was started. Changing the region selection in the console will not change the region for existing Cloud Shell instances; you will need to open a new Cloud Shell instance to change regions.\nCloud Shell sessions have a maximum length of 24 hours, and time out after 60\n                minutes of inactivity.\n\nCloud Shell uses websockets to communicate between your browser and the service.\n                    If your browser has websockets disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has\n                    websockets disabled you will see an error message (\"An unexpected error\n                    occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud Shell from the console.\n\nCloud Shell is designed for interactive use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Users who need additional storage for Cloud Shell or want to run non-interactive long-running tasks are encouraged to use Compute and Storage resources in their tenancy.\nFor maximum compatibility, Cloud Shell includes Python version 2 and Python version\n                3. Python 2 is the default that will run when you enter 'python' at the command\n                line. To run Python 3, enter 'python3' at the command line.\nThe following reserved words can't be used as the user name for a Cloud Shell user: oci, root, bin, daemon, adm, lp, sync, shutdown, halt, mai, operator, games, ftp, nobody, oci, systemd-network, dbus, polkitd, tss, and apache. Attempting to create a Cloud Shell session when logged in with a user name (or the part of the name before the @ sign if the user name is an email address)\u00c2\u00a0that is one of these reserved words will result in an \"Unexpected Error\" message.\nEntirely numerical user names (for example, \"1234\")\u00c2\u00a0are not supported by Cloud Shell.\nThe Cloud Shell session time zone is UTC, and cannot be changed.\nCloud Shell does not allow root access or the use of sudo, so packages that require\n                root access for installation can't be installed. Many packages are available in\n                versions that do not require root for installation; you can unpack and install these\n                in your home directory. \nCloud Shell does not allow the use of ping, since ping requires root access.\nCloud Shell boots in FIPS mode, which might affect the behavior of some commands.\nCloud Shell cannot generate PKCS#1 keys when using the openssl command, because Cloud Shell boots in FIPS mode. FIPS mode requires that Cloud Shell generates PKCS#8 keys.\nFor more information on Cloud Shell limits, see the Cloud Shell section in Service Limits. \n\nCloud Shell Access and Other Restrictions\nYou can access OCI resources from Cloud Shell according to the policies granted by\n                your tenancy administrator. There is no additional access because you're using Cloud\n                Shell, and Cloud Shell does not provide any additional access to your tenancy, or\n                private resources in your tenancy VCNs. Note Cloud Shell uses websockets to\n                    communicate between your browser and the service. If your browser has websockets\n                    disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has websockets disabled you will see an\n                    error message (\"An unexpected error occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud\n                    Shell from the console.\nWhile Cloud Shell provides access to the internet, there is no ingress from the\n                outside world into Cloud Shell (for example: you cannot ssh in to Cloud Shell) and\n                no public IP address available. If your tenancy admin does not want to enable access\n                to the internet from OCI, they should not grant access to Cloud Shell with an IAM\n                policy.\n\n"

This storage is persistent from session to session, but after 6-months of non-use, the administrator for your tenancy will receive a notification that the storage will be removed in 60 days. Starting a cloud shell session resets the storage removal timer.\nCloud Shell does not support mounting additional storage.\nCloud Shell does not scan user files for malware or viruses.\nCloud Shell sessions do not allow for any incoming connections, and there is no\n                public IP address available.\nThe OCI CLI will execute commands against the region selected in the Console's Region selection menu when the Cloud Shell was started. Changing the region selection in the console will not change the region for existing Cloud Shell instances; you will need to open a new Cloud Shell instance to change regions.\nCloud Shell sessions have a maximum length of 24 hours, and time out after 60\n                minutes of inactivity.\n\nCloud Shell uses websockets to communicate between your browser and the service.\n                    If your browser has websockets disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has\n                    websockets disabled you will see an error message (\"An unexpected error\n                    occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud Shell from the console.\n\nCloud Shell is designed for interactive use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Users who need additional storage for Cloud Shell or want to run non-interactive long-running tasks are encouraged to use Compute and Storage resources in their tenancy.\nFor maximum compatibility, Cloud Shell includes Python version 2 and Python version\n                3. Python 2 is the default that will run when you enter 'python' at the command\n                line.

Attempting to create a Cloud Shell session when logged in with a user name (or the part of the name before the @ sign if the user name is an email address)\u00c2\u00a0that is one of these reserved words will result in an \"Unexpected Error\" message.\nEntirely numerical user names (for example, \"1234\")\u00c2\u00a0are not supported by Cloud Shell.\nThe Cloud Shell session time zone is UTC, and cannot be changed.\nCloud Shell does not allow root access or the use of sudo, so packages that require\n                root access for installation can't be installed.

There is no additional access because you're using Cloud\n                Shell, and Cloud Shell does not provide any additional access to your tenancy, or\n                private resources in your tenancy VCNs. Note Cloud Shell uses websockets to\n                    communicate between your browser and the service. If your browser has websockets\n                    disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has websockets disabled you will see an\n                    error message (\"An unexpected error occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud\n                    Shell from the console.\nWhile Cloud Shell provides access to the internet, there is no ingress from the\n                outside world into Cloud Shell (for example: you cannot ssh in to Cloud Shell) and\n                no public IP address available. If your tenancy admin does not want to enable access\n                to the internet from OCI, they should not grant access to Cloud Shell with an IAM\n                policy.\n\n"

Examples of where Private Networking can be useful\n            include using it to SSH into compute instances inside of a private network or managing a\n            private OKE cluster.\n Note A Cloud Shell instance is a private instance, and works like a private instance for the purposes of network setup. Using only an internet gateway will not allow egress to the internet from a private subnet. Using a service gateway or a NAT gateway will. For more information, see the Internet Gateway documentation.\nRequirements and IAM Policy\nTo use Private Networking, you (or an administrator) will need to specify the\n                following policies:\n\n\nallow group <group> to use subnets in compartment <compartment>\n\n\nallow group <group> to use vnics in compartment <compartment>\n\n\nallow group <group> to use network-security-groups in compartment <compartment>\n\n\nallow group <group> to inspect vcns in compartment <compartment>\n\n\nIf you're new to policies, see Getting Started with Policies and Common Policies.\nYou'll also need to create private VCNs and Subnets in the appropriate compartments.\n                For more information, see VCNs and Subnets in\n                the Networking\n                documentation. \n\nGetting Started with Private NetworkingTo\n            change which network your Cloud Shell session is using, use the drop-down Network\n            menu at the top of the Cloud Shell terminal window:From this menu you can select a favorite private network connection.\n                To see more options, you can select the Private Network Definition List item,\n                which will display the Private Network Definition List panel.

Select the VCN and the Subnet to use from the drop-down list boxes. You can also\n                optionally select one or more Network Security groups to use.  Note Only VCNs and Subnets in your home region are available.\n                    If you need to access a subnet in a region that is not your home region, you can\n                    use peering from the subnet used by Private Networking to reach it. For more\n                    information, see VCN Cross-Region Peering.  Note A subnet chosen for a Cloudshell Private Network\n                            must have at least one non-reserved IP address for the subnet's CIDR\n                            block available.

This storage is persistent from session to session, but after 6-months of non-use, the administrator for your tenancy will receive a notification that the storage will be removed in 60 days. Starting a cloud shell session resets the storage removal timer.\nCloud Shell does not support mounting additional storage.\nCloud Shell does not scan user files for malware or viruses.\nCloud Shell sessions do not allow for any incoming connections, and there is no\n                public IP address available.\nThe OCI CLI will execute commands against the region selected in the Console's Region selection menu when the Cloud Shell was started. Changing the region selection in the console will not change the region for existing Cloud Shell instances; you will need to open a new Cloud Shell instance to change regions.\nCloud Shell sessions have a maximum length of 24 hours, and time out after 60\n                minutes of inactivity.\n\nCloud Shell uses websockets to communicate between your browser and the service.\n                    If your browser has websockets disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has\n                    websockets disabled you will see an error message (\"An unexpected error\n                    occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud Shell from the console.\n\nCloud Shell is designed for interactive use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Users who need additional storage for Cloud Shell or want to run non-interactive long-running tasks are encouraged to use Compute and Storage resources in their tenancy.\nFor maximum compatibility, Cloud Shell includes Python version 2 and Python version\n                3. Python 2 is the default that will run when you enter 'python' at the command\n                line. To run Python 3, enter 'python3' at the command line.\nThe following reserved words can't be used as the user name for a Cloud Shell user: oci, root, bin, daemon, adm, lp, sync, shutdown, halt, mai, operator, games, ftp, nobody, oci, systemd-network, dbus, polkitd, tss, and apache. Attempting to create a Cloud Shell session when logged in with a user name (or the part of the name before the @ sign if the user name is an email address)\u00c2\u00a0that is one of these reserved words will result in an \"Unexpected Error\" message.\nEntirely numerical user names (for example, \"1234\")\u00c2\u00a0are not supported by Cloud Shell.\nThe Cloud Shell session time zone is UTC, and cannot be changed.\nCloud Shell does not allow root access or the use of sudo, so packages that require\n                root access for installation can't be installed. Many packages are available in\n                versions that do not require root for installation; you can unpack and install these\n                in your home directory. \nCloud Shell does not allow the use of ping, since ping requires root access.\nCloud Shell boots in FIPS mode, which might affect the behavior of some commands.\nCloud Shell cannot generate PKCS#1 keys when using the openssl command, because Cloud Shell boots in FIPS mode. FIPS mode requires that Cloud Shell generates PKCS#8 keys.\nFor more information on Cloud Shell limits, see the Cloud Shell section in Service Limits. \n\nCloud Shell Access and Other Restrictions\nYou can access OCI resources from Cloud Shell according to the policies granted by\n                your tenancy administrator. There is no additional access because you're using Cloud\n                Shell, and Cloud Shell does not provide any additional access to your tenancy, or\n                private resources in your tenancy VCNs. Note Cloud Shell uses websockets to\n                    communicate between your browser and the service. If your browser has websockets\n                    disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has websockets disabled you will see an\n                    error message (\"An unexpected error occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud\n                    Shell from the console.\nWhile Cloud Shell provides access to the internet, there is no ingress from the\n                outside world into Cloud Shell (for example: you cannot ssh in to Cloud Shell) and\n                no public IP address available.

Examples of where Private Networking can be useful\n            include using it to SSH into compute instances inside of a private network or managing a\n            private OKE cluster.\n Note A Cloud Shell instance is a private instance, and works like a private instance for the purposes of network setup. Using only an internet gateway will not allow egress to the internet from a private subnet. Using a service gateway or a NAT gateway will.

Select the VCN and the Subnet to use from the drop-down list boxes. You can also\n                optionally select one or more Network Security groups to use.  Note Only VCNs and Subnets in your home region are available.\n                    If you need to access a subnet in a region that is not your home region, you can\n                    use peering from the subnet used by Private Networking to reach it. For more\n                    information, see VCN Cross-Region Peering.  Note A subnet chosen for a Cloudshell Private Network\n                            must have at least one non-reserved IP address for the subnet's CIDR\n                            block available.

Look for corresponding failures and  similar operations preceding the failures to correlate a reason for the failures. \n Note The service logs events at the time they are processed. There can be a delay between the time an operation occurs and when it is processed.\nYou can filter results by request actions to zero in on only the events with operations that interest you. For example, say that you only want to know about instances that were deleted during a specific time frame. Select a delete  request action filter to see only the events with delete operations.\nYou can also filter by keywords. Keyword filters are powerful when combined with the values from audit event fields. For example, say that you know the user name of an account and want a list of all activity by that account in a particular time frame. Do a search using the user name as a keyword filter. \nEvery audit event contains the same fields, so search for values from those fields.

        "text": "oracle cloud infrastructure, oci, Cloud Shell service, \n Cloud Shell Limitations, \nKeep the following limitations in mind when using Cloud Shell:\n\nCloud Shell comes with 5GB\u00c2\u00a0of storage for the VM's home directory. This storage is persistent from session to session, but after 6-months of non-use, the administrator for your tenancy will receive a notification that the storage will be removed in 60 days. Starting a cloud shell session resets the storage removal timer.\nCloud Shell does not support mounting additional storage.\nCloud Shell does not scan user files for malware or viruses.\nCloud Shell sessions do not allow for any incoming connections, and there is no\n                public IP address available.\nThe OCI CLI will execute commands against the region selected in the Console's Region selection menu when the Cloud Shell was started. Changing the region selection in the console will not change the region for existing Cloud Shell instances; you will need to open a new Cloud Shell instance to change regions.\nCloud Shell sessions have a maximum length of 24 hours, and time out after 60\n                minutes of inactivity.\n\nCloud Shell uses websockets to communicate between your browser and the service.\n                    If your browser has websockets disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has\n                    websockets disabled you will see an error message (\"An unexpected error\n                    occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud Shell from the console.\n\nCloud Shell is designed for interactive use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Users who need additional storage for Cloud Shell or want to run non-interactive long-running tasks are encouraged to use Compute and Storage resources in their tenancy.\nFor maximum compatibility, Cloud Shell includes Python version 2 and Python version\n                3. Python 2 is the default that will run when you enter 'python' at the command\n                line. To run Python 3, enter 'python3' at the command line.\nThe following reserved words can't be used as the user name for a Cloud Shell user: oci, root, bin, daemon, adm, lp, sync, shutdown, halt, mai, operator, games, ftp, nobody, oci, systemd-network, dbus, polkitd, tss, and apache. Attempting to create a Cloud Shell session when logged in with a user name (or the part of the name before the @ sign if the user name is an email address)\u00c2\u00a0that is one of these reserved words will result in an \"Unexpected Error\" message.\nEntirely numerical user names (for example, \"1234\")\u00c2\u00a0are not supported by Cloud Shell.\nThe Cloud Shell session time zone is UTC, and cannot be changed.\nCloud Shell does not allow root access or the use of sudo, so packages that require\n                root access for installation can't be installed. Many packages are available in\n                versions that do not require root for installation; you can unpack and install these\n                in your home directory. \nCloud Shell does not allow the use of ping, since ping requires root access.\nCloud Shell boots in FIPS mode, which might affect the behavior of some commands.\nCloud Shell cannot generate PKCS#1 keys when using the openssl command, because Cloud Shell boots in FIPS mode. FIPS mode requires that Cloud Shell generates PKCS#8 keys.\nFor more information on Cloud Shell limits, see the Cloud Shell section in Service Limits. \n\nCloud Shell Access and Other Restrictions\nYou can access OCI resources from Cloud Shell according to the policies granted by\n                your tenancy administrator. There is no additional access because you're using Cloud\n                Shell, and Cloud Shell does not provide any additional access to your tenancy, or\n                private resources in your tenancy VCNs. Note Cloud Shell uses websockets to\n                    communicate between your browser and the service. If your browser has websockets\n                    disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has websockets disabled you will see an\n                    error message (\"An unexpected error occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud\n                    Shell from the console.\nWhile Cloud Shell provides access to the internet, there is no ingress from the\n                outside world into Cloud Shell (for example: you cannot ssh in to Cloud Shell) and\n                no public IP address available. If your tenancy admin does not want to enable access\n                to the internet from OCI, they should not grant access to Cloud Shell with an IAM\n                policy.\n\n"

The capacity is reclaimed when it's needed elsewhere. The capacity is not guaranteed for a minimum amount of time, so instances can be reclaimed at any time. The benefit is that preemptible capacity costs less than on-demand capacity. Therefore, for workloads that can be interrupted, preemptible capacity can lower your costs.\nUsing Preemptible Capacity\nTo use preemptible capacity, follow the standard process for creating an instance, and for Capacity type, select Preemptible capacity.\nWhen preemptible capacity is reclaimed, the instance is terminated. Use the Events service to receive notifications when this event occurs.\n\nSupport and Limitations\nPreemptible instances have the following limitations and restrictions:\n\nPreemptible instances can be terminated (deleted) at any time. As a result, they are not suitable for long-running workloads.\nPreemptible capacity cannot be used with capacity reservations or with the dedicated virtual machine host feature.\nPreemptible capacity does not support bare metal instances, burstable instances, or instances that have a minimum billing time.\nWhen you edit an instance that uses preemptible capacity, only the name of the instance can be changed. You cannot change the shape of the instance after it is launched, and you cannot convert a preemptible instance to an on-demand instance.\nAfter you create a preemptible instance, you cannot start, stop, or reboot the instance.\nPreemptible instances do not support sending diagnostic interrupts.\nPreemptible instances do not support confidential computing.\nYou cannot use preemptible instances to create instance configurations, and preemptible instances cannot be used in instance pools.\nPreemptible instances do not support instance migration after infrastructure maintenance events. During maintenance events that impact the underlying infrastructure, the capacity is reclaimed, and the instance is terminated.\nThe standard compute instance service limits and compartment quotas apply to preemptible instances. If your request for compute instances will exceed your service limits, request a service limit increase before you create the instance.

The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure documentation provides related terminology.\n\nKnowledge Base\nA knowledge base is associated with vulnerability audits. When you configure a vulnerability audit, you specify the knowledge base with which it is associated.\n\n\nVulnerability\nA vulnerability is a weakness or error in a project artifact, such as an application dependency. A vulnerability is a generalization of an information security flaw, such as those described by the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) system. The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) provides a measure of the severity of a software vulnerability, using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), ranging from 0 to 10. The NVD supports both CVSS v2.0 and v3.X standards. For more information about vulnerability metrics, see National Vulnerability Database.\n\n\nVulnerability Audit\nA vulnerability audit describes the vulnerabilities of your application and its dependencies.

This storage is persistent from session to session, but after 6-months of non-use, the administrator for your tenancy will receive a notification that the storage will be removed in 60 days. Starting a cloud shell session resets the storage removal timer.\nCloud Shell does not support mounting additional storage.\nCloud Shell does not scan user files for malware or viruses.\nCloud Shell sessions do not allow for any incoming connections, and there is no\n                public IP address available.\nThe OCI CLI will execute commands against the region selected in the Console's Region selection menu when the Cloud Shell was started. Changing the region selection in the console will not change the region for existing Cloud Shell instances; you will need to open a new Cloud Shell instance to change regions.\nCloud Shell sessions have a maximum length of 24 hours, and time out after 60\n                minutes of inactivity.\n\nCloud Shell uses websockets to communicate between your browser and the service.\n                    If your browser has websockets disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has\n                    websockets disabled you will see an error message (\"An unexpected error\n                    occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud Shell from the console.\n\nCloud Shell is designed for interactive use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Users who need additional storage for Cloud Shell or want to run non-interactive long-running tasks are encouraged to use Compute and Storage resources in their tenancy.\nFor maximum compatibility, Cloud Shell includes Python version 2 and Python version\n                3. Python 2 is the default that will run when you enter 'python' at the command\n                line. To run Python 3, enter 'python3' at the command line.\nThe following reserved words can't be used as the user name for a Cloud Shell user: oci, root, bin, daemon, adm, lp, sync, shutdown, halt, mai, operator, games, ftp, nobody, oci, systemd-network, dbus, polkitd, tss, and apache. Attempting to create a Cloud Shell session when logged in with a user name (or the part of the name before the @ sign if the user name is an email address)\u00c2\u00a0that is one of these reserved words will result in an \"Unexpected Error\" message.\nEntirely numerical user names (for example, \"1234\")\u00c2\u00a0are not supported by Cloud Shell.\nThe Cloud Shell session time zone is UTC, and cannot be changed.\nCloud Shell does not allow root access or the use of sudo, so packages that require\n                root access for installation can't be installed. Many packages are available in\n                versions that do not require root for installation; you can unpack and install these\n                in your home directory. \nCloud Shell does not allow the use of ping, since ping requires root access.\nCloud Shell boots in FIPS mode, which might affect the behavior of some commands.\nCloud Shell cannot generate PKCS#1 keys when using the openssl command, because Cloud Shell boots in FIPS mode. FIPS mode requires that Cloud Shell generates PKCS#8 keys.\nFor more information on Cloud Shell limits, see the Cloud Shell section in Service Limits. \n\nCloud Shell Access and Other Restrictions\nYou can access OCI resources from Cloud Shell according to the policies granted by\n                your tenancy administrator. There is no additional access because you're using Cloud\n                Shell, and Cloud Shell does not provide any additional access to your tenancy, or\n                private resources in your tenancy VCNs. Note Cloud Shell uses websockets to\n                    communicate between your browser and the service. If your browser has websockets\n                    disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has websockets disabled you will see an\n                    error message (\"An unexpected error occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud\n                    Shell from the console.\nWhile Cloud Shell provides access to the internet, there is no ingress from the\n                outside world into Cloud Shell (for example: you cannot ssh in to Cloud Shell) and\n                no public IP address available.

This user does not have an OCI\n      Identity and Access Management (IAM) identity, so it has no access to the OCI API. OCI\n      resources include Data Science projects and models and the resources of other OCI services,\n      such as Object Storage, Functions, Vault, Data Flow, and so on. To access these resources from\n      the notebook environment, use one of the two authentication approaches:\n(Recommended) Authenticating Using a Notebook Session's Resource Principal\nA resource principal is a feature of IAM that enables resources to be authorized\n          principal actors that can perform actions on service resources. Each resource has\n        its own identity, and it authenticates using the certificates that are added to it. These\n        certificates are automatically created, assigned to resources, and rotated, avoiding the\n        need for you to store credentials in your notebook session.\nThe Data Science service enables you to authenticate using\n        your notebook session's resource principal to access other OCI resources. Resource\n        principals provides a more secure way to authenticate to resources compared to the OCI\n        configuration and API key approach\nYour tenancy administrator must write policies to grant permissions for your resource\n        principal to access other OCI resources, see Configuring Your Tenancy for Data Science.\nYou can authenticate with resource principals in a notebook session using the following\n        interfaces:\n\nOracle Accelerated Data Science SDK:\n\nRun the following in a notebook cell:\nimport ads\nads.set_auth(auth='resource_principal')\nFor details, see the Accelerated Data Science documentation.\n\nOCI Python SDK:\n\nRun the following in a notebook cell.\nimport oci\nfrom oci.data_science import DataScienceClient\nrps = oci.auth.signers.get_resource_principals_signer()\ndsc = DataScienceClient(config={}, signer=rps)\n\nOCI CLI:\n\nUse the `--auth=resource_principal` flag with commands. \n\n\n Note The resource principal token is cached for 15 minutes. If you change the policy or the\n        dynamic group, you have to wait for 15 minutes to see the effect of your changes.\n Important\nIf you don't explicitly use the resource principals when invoking an SDK or CLI, then the\n          configuration file and API key approach is used\n\n\n(Default) Authenticating Using OCI Configuration File and API Keys\nYou can operate as your own personal IAM user by setting up an OCI configuration file and\n        API keys to access OCI resources. This is the default authentication approach\nTo authenticate using the configuration file and API key approach, you must upload an OCI\n        configuration file into the notebook session's /home/datascience/.oci/\n        directory. For the relevant profile defined in the OCI configuration file, you also need to\n        upload or create the required .pem files. \nYou can use the api_keys.ipynb notebook to interactively create OCI configuration and API key files.

        "text": "oracle cloud infrastructure, oci, Model Deployment Policies service, \n You must create a group of users that are authorized to work with model deployments\n        before you can deploy a model with a model deployment resource.\n\nAlternatively, you could create a dynamic group of resources (like notebook sessions)\n                that is authorized to create a deployment. In this case, anyone who can access the\n                notebook session can take the identity of the notebook session and create a model\n                deployment. The authentication method from the notebook session uses resource\n                principals. \nThe same pattern applies when invoking the model endpoint after deployment. A group\n                of users or resources need to be authorized to invoke the model. \nWe believe that the following examples are the most common policy statements for use\n                with a model deployment and example model deployment policies contains\n                more examples.\n\nManage Model Deployment Policies\nAllows a group of users, <your-group>\n                to perform all CRUD operations on models stored in the model catalog. Any user who\n                wants to deploy a model through model deployment also needs to access the model they\n                want to deploy.\n                allow group <your-group> to manage data-science-models \nin compartment <your-compartment-name>\nAllows a group of users, <your-group> to perform all CRUD operations, including calling the predict endpoint, on model deployment resources in a particular compartment. You can change the manage verb to limit what the users can do. allow group <your-group> to manage data-science-model-deployments \nin compartment <your-compartment-name>\nAllows a dynamic group of resources (like notebook sessions) to\n                perform all CRUD operations, including calling the predict endpoint, on model\n                deployment resources in a particular compartment. The manage verb\n                can be changed to limit what the resources can do.\n                allow dynamic-group <your-dynamic-group> to manage  data-science-model-deployments \nin compartment <your-compartment-name>\nThe preceding policy examples are permissive. You can create more restrictive policies. A common example is to restrict who or what resources can invoke the predict endpoint of the model deployment. \n\nAuthorize Access to Predict Endpoint Policy\nAllows a group of users, <your-group> to perform all CRUD operations, including calling the predict endpoint, on model deployment resources in a particular compartment. You can change the manage verb to limit what the users can do. allow group <your-group> to manage data-science-model-deployments \nin compartment <your-compartment-name>\nAlternatively, you can authorize resources to do the same. Only the dynamic group of resources in your specified dynamic group can call the model endpoint for the model deployment resources created in a specific compartment. allow dynamic-group <your-dynamic-group-2> to {DATA_SCIENCE_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_PREDICT} \nin compartment <your-compartment-name>\n\nGive Model Deployment Access to Your Published Conda Bucket\n(Optional) Allows a model deployment to access the published conda environments stored in your Object Storage bucket. This is required if you want to use Published Conda Environments to capture the third-party dependencies of your model. allow any-user to read objects in compartment <your-compartment-name>\nwhere ALL { request.principal.type='datasciencemodeldeployment', \ntarget.bucket.name=<your-published-conda-envs-bucket-name> }\n\nGive Model Deployment Access to the Logging Service\n(Optional) Allows a model deployment to emit logs to the Logging service. You need this policy if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re using Logging in your Model Deployment. This statement is very permissive. For example, you could restrict the permission to use log-content in a specific compartment.allow any-user to use log-content in tenancy \nwhere ALL {request.principal.type = 'datasciencemodeldeployment'}\n\n\nGive Model Deployment Access to an Object Storage Bucket\n(Optional) Allows a model deployment to access an Object Storage bucket\n                that resides in your tenancy. For example, a deployed model reading files (a lookup\n                CSV file) from an Object Storage bucket that you manage.\n                allow any-user to read objects in compartment <your-compartment-name> \nwhere ALL { request.principal.type='datasciencemodeldeployment', target.bucket.name=<your-bucket-name> }\n\nOther Methods of Authentication and Authorization \nModel deployment only supports authorization and authentication defined by the OCI Identity and Access Management (IAM) service. Model deployment does not support other methods of authorization and authentication such as OAuth or basic access authentication. \n\n"

Resource\n        principals provides a more secure way to authenticate to resources compared to the OCI\n        configuration and API key approach\nYour tenancy administrator must write policies to grant permissions for your resource\n        principal to access other OCI resources, see Configuring Your Tenancy for Data Science.\nYou can authenticate with resource principals in a notebook session using the following\n        interfaces:\n\nOracle Accelerated Data Science SDK:\n\nRun the following in a notebook cell:\nimport ads\nads.set_auth(auth='resource_principal')\nFor details, see the Accelerated Data Science documentation.\n\nOCI Python SDK:\n\nRun the following in a notebook cell.\nimport oci\nfrom oci.data_science import DataScienceClient\nrps = oci.auth.signers.get_resource_principals_signer()\ndsc = DataScienceClient(config={}, signer=rps)\n\nOCI CLI:\n\nUse the `--auth=resource_principal` flag with commands. \n\n\n Note The resource principal token is cached for 15 minutes. If you change the policy or the\n        dynamic group, you have to wait for 15 minutes to see the effect of your changes.\n Important\nIf you don't explicitly use the resource principals when invoking an SDK or CLI, then the\n          configuration file and API key approach is used\n\n\n(Default) Authenticating Using OCI Configuration File and API Keys\nYou can operate as your own personal IAM user by setting up an OCI configuration file and\n        API keys to access OCI resources. This is the default authentication approach\nTo authenticate using the configuration file and API key approach, you must upload an OCI\n        configuration file into the notebook session's /home/datascience/.oci/\n        directory.

        "text": "oracle cloud infrastructure, oci, Known Issues service, \n Linux User Namespace Remapping Failure with a Docker Container, \n\nDetails\n\nThe user namespace (userns) feature of the Linux kernel adds another security layer to Linux containers. It allows a host machine to run containers outside its user ID (UID) or group ID (GID) namespace. This means that all containers can have a root account (UID 0) in their own namespace, and run processes without receiving root privileges from the host machine. When a userns is created, the Linux kernel provides a mapping between the container and the host machine. For example, if you start a container and run a process with UID 0 inside it (usually root account in the container), the Linux kernel maps the container\u00e2\u0080\u0099s UID 0 to a non-privileged UID on the host machine. This allows the container to run a process as if it were the root user, while actually being run by the non-root user on the host machine.\nThe error is caused by a userns remapping failure. When the host machine files are configured with a valid UID or GID for remapping, the UID or GID must be in the range of 0\u00e2\u0080\u009365535. When a job starts the Docker container, Docker pulls an image and extracts layers from that image. If a layer contains files with UID or GID outside of the accepted range, then Docker can't successfully remap so the container fails to start.\nFor example, if a file exists with UID and GID higher at the allowed range. If you copy this file into the Docker image, it can keep the high UID and GID.\nIf you run the container image and the file must be used in the container, then the container fails. \n\nWorkaround 1\n\nEnsure that none of the files that are used in your Docker image have high UID or GID.\n\nWorkaround 2\n\nIf you don't know which file has high UID or GID in your image, you can find them with:\n\n\nEnter the container with:\ndocker run it <image-name> sh\n\n\nSearch for files with high UID/GID:\n\n\nFind users:\nfind / \\( -uid 1000000 \\) -ls 2>/dev/null\n\n\nFind groups: \nfind / \\( -gid 1000000 \\) -ls 2>/dev/null\n\n\nThe 1000000 number is different because it is the ID error.\n\nIf you find files, ensure that the UID or GID is lower, either in the location where the file is stored or in the container.\n\n\nWorkaround 3\n\nIn your Docker file, after you copy the files you need in the image run one of the following: \nOn the folder: \nRUN chown -R root:root /root \nDirectly on the file:\nRUN chown -R root:root job_logs.py\n\n\n"

        "text": "oracle cloud infrastructure, oci, Preparing Job Artifacts service, \n Learn how create a job artifact to use in your jobs and job runs.\nJobs artifact can be maximum of 4 GB. These are the types of job artifacts that you can use:\n\n\nPython Files\n\n\nBash or Shell Scripts\n\n\nZIP or Compressed Tar Files\n\n\nPython Files\nThe artifact can be a simple, single Python file that contains code to run a job like\n                this Python file example:\n# simple job\nimport time\n \nprint(\"Hello job world!\")\ntime.sleep(3)\nprint(\"Job Done.\")\nThis job prints two messages with a time sleep of three seconds in between. You could\n                save the code into a single hello_world_job.py file, and then run\n                it as a job. Job runs already provide Python preinstalled, and can run the code with\n                all Python system libraries. \nThis example doesn't  use third-party Python libraries. You control the installed\n                Python libraries and environments by using your job in a conda environment.\n\nBash or Shell Scripts\nYou can use a single script file as in this example or more complex one:\n#!/bin/bash\nvar=$1\nif [ -z \"$var\" ]\nthen\n      echo \"no argument provided\"\n      exit 100\nelse\n      while [ \"$1\" != \"\" ]; do\n        echo \"Received: ${1}\" && shift;\n      done\nfi\nThese types of job runs are run using Oracle Linux.\n\nZIP or Compressed Tar Files\nOften your projects are more complex and require more code than is feasible in a\n                single file. If you have complex Python project and shell scripts, you can archive\n                the entire body of content and run it as job. Using a fat JAR file, you can run Java\n                code as a job. \nThere aren't special requirements about how to write your Python code or shell script to run it as a job. You can point to your main file using the JOB_RUN_ENTRYPOINT parameter after you upload the ZIP or compressed tar artifact. \nThe ZIP and compressed tar artifacts can also have a runtime YAML file that sets the\n                required job run environment variables. \nArchive file considerations:\n\n\nAll of your code must be archived under a root directory.\n\n\nThe file name should match the root directory name that you set with JOB_RUN_ENTRYPOINT.\nThe JOB_RUN_ENTRYPOINT displays in the Job Runs Details page\n                        when it is in use. \n\n\nDon't change the name of the archive file after you compress your\n                        directory.\n\n\nGet started with the sample by downloading, unzipping, and examining the zipped_python_job.zip file.\nThe ZIP file contains a simple logging job which is archived into a ZIP file under the zipped_python_job/ directory. You can run the job by specifying the location of the main python file by setting the JOB_RUN_ENTRYPOINT environment variable, either in the OCI Console or using the OCI SDK:\n\"environmentVariables\": {\n    \"JOB_RUN_ENTRYPOINT\": \"zipped_python_job/entry.py\"\n}\nUse these steps to create a job artifact file:\n\nCreate a root directory for your project. \nCreate your job code under the root directory. The job code in its entirety must be under the root directory.\nCompress the root directory to a ZIP or tar file.\n\nNow you can upload the archive file as a job artifact when you\n                    create a job. When creating the job, add the\n                    JOB_RUN_ENTRYPOINT as a custom environment variable in the job\n                configuration.\n\n"

This user does not have an OCI\n      Identity and Access Management (IAM) identity, so it has no access to the OCI API. OCI\n      resources include Data Science projects and models and the resources of other OCI services,\n      such as Object Storage, Functions, Vault, Data Flow, and so on. To access these resources from\n      the notebook environment, use one of the two authentication approaches:\n(Recommended) Authenticating Using a Notebook Session's Resource Principal\nA resource principal is a feature of IAM that enables resources to be authorized\n          principal actors that can perform actions on service resources. Each resource has\n        its own identity, and it authenticates using the certificates that are added to it. These\n        certificates are automatically created, assigned to resources, and rotated, avoiding the\n        need for you to store credentials in your notebook session.\nThe Data Science service enables you to authenticate using\n        your notebook session's resource principal to access other OCI resources. Resource\n        principals provides a more secure way to authenticate to resources compared to the OCI\n        configuration and API key approach\nYour tenancy administrator must write policies to grant permissions for your resource\n        principal to access other OCI resources, see Configuring Your Tenancy for Data Science.\nYou can authenticate with resource principals in a notebook session using the following\n        interfaces:\n\nOracle Accelerated Data Science SDK:\n\nRun the following in a notebook cell:\nimport ads\nads.set_auth(auth='resource_principal')\nFor details, see the Accelerated Data Science documentation.\n\nOCI Python SDK:\n\nRun the following in a notebook cell.\nimport oci\nfrom oci.data_science import DataScienceClient\nrps = oci.auth.signers.get_resource_principals_signer()\ndsc = DataScienceClient(config={}, signer=rps)\n\nOCI CLI:\n\nUse the `--auth=resource_principal` flag with commands. \n\n\n Note The resource principal token is cached for 15 minutes. If you change the policy or the\n        dynamic group, you have to wait for 15 minutes to see the effect of your changes.\n Important\nIf you don't explicitly use the resource principals when invoking an SDK or CLI, then the\n          configuration file and API key approach is used\n\n\n(Default) Authenticating Using OCI Configuration File and API Keys\nYou can operate as your own personal IAM user by setting up an OCI configuration file and\n        API keys to access OCI resources. This is the default authentication approach\nTo authenticate using the configuration file and API key approach, you must upload an OCI\n        configuration file into the notebook session's /home/datascience/.oci/\n        directory. For the relevant profile defined in the OCI configuration file, you also need to\n        upload or create the required .pem files. \nYou can use the api_keys.ipynb notebook to interactively create OCI configuration and API key files. To launch the api_keys.ipynb notebook, click Notebook Examples in the JupyterLab Launcher tab.\n\n"

These\n        outputs are not available to the Data Science service. We\n        highly recommended that you enable the logging integration for jobs, both for debugging any\n        potential issues and for monitoring the progress of running your job artifacts.\nStandard out messages are categorized under the\n          \"com.oraclecloud.datascience.jobrun.stdout\" type, while standard error\n        messages are under the \"com.oraclecloud.datascience.jobrun.stderr\" type.\n        For both types, the log metadata includes the \"source\", which is the OCID\n        of the job run that outputs the messages.\nWhen logging integration is enabled in the job logging configurations, you can either:\n\n\nProvide your own log group and your own log to capture job run outputs. You can\n            configure all the job runs to use the same log though we don't recommended it. Log\n            messages are easier to read when each job run outputs to its own log.\nOr\n\n\nProvide your own log group, but enable the Data Science\n            service to automatically create custom logs on your behalf at the start of each job run\n            within your specified log group. If automatic log creation is enabled, there is no need\n            for you to configure logs yourself before each job run.

This information includes the time the request\n              was received, error codes, and so on. If you are experiencing problems with your model\n              deployment, access logs are generally the first log you want to look at. \nThe metadata captured by model deployment access logs are: \n\nlogEmissionTime\n\nThe time, in UTC, when the log was emitted from the code. \n\nmessage\n\nThe request path.\n\nmodelLatency\n\nThe time taken to process a request on the model server in milliseconds.\n\nopcRequestId\n\nThe request Id. This value is the same requestId that is\n                    retrieved in the response.\n\nstatus\n\nThe request response status code. \n\n\nFor example, an access log entry for model deployment could be:\n\"data\": {\n  \"logEmissionTime\": \"2021-01-25T07:23:39.101Z\",\n  \"message\": \"POST /predict 1.1\",\n  \"modelLatency\": 4.43,\n  \"opcRequestId\": \"0BC0860C17DC46D79A0A1A7B4F139829\",\n  \"status\": 200\n}\n\nPredict Logs\n\nPredict logs originate from logging (stdout and\n                stderr) calls made custom code execution in the model artifact\n              Python files. Predict logs can emit useful information about the model and are\n              entirely customizable.

ADS has many functions and objects that automates or simplifies the steps in the Data Science workflow, including connecting to data, exploring and visualizing data, training a model with AutoML, evaluating models, and explaining models. In addition, ADS provides a simple interface to access the Data Science service model catalog and other OCI services including Object Storage. To familiarize yourself with ADS, see the Accelerated Data Science Library.\n\nProjects\n\nProjects are collaborative workspaces for organizing and documenting Data Science assets, such as notebook sessions and models.\n\nNotebook Sessions\n\nData Science notebook sessions are interactive coding environments for building and training models. Notebook sessions come with many preinstalled open source and Oracle developed machine learning and data science packages.\n\nConda Environments\n\nConda is an open-source environment and package management system and was created for\n            Python programs. It quickly installs, runs, and updates packages and their dependencies.\n            Conda easily creates, saves, loads, and switches between environments on your local\n            computer.\n\nModels\n\nModels define a mathematical representation of your data and business process. The\n            model catalog is a place to store, track, share, and manage models.\n\nModel Deployments\n\nModel deployments are a managed resource in the Data Science service that allows you to deploy models stored in the model catalog as HTTP endpoints. Deploying machine learning models as web applications (HTTP API endpoints) serving predictions in real time is the most common way to productionized models. HTTP endpoints are flexible and can serve requests for model predictions. \n\nJobs\n\nData Science jobs enable you to define and run repeatable machine learning tasks on a fully-managed infrastructure.\n\nPipelines\n\nA Data Science pipeline is an executable construct that describes an end-to-end machine learning orchestration that can be executed in a repeatable way.\n\nLogs\n\nIntegrate the Logging service into Data Science to create and manage custom logs.\n\nMetrics\n\nMonitor the health, capacity, and performance of some Data Science resources using metrics, alarms, and notifications.\n\n\nYou should also be familiar with the OCI Key Concepts.\n"

When you create Data Science\n   resources, such as notebook sessions, models, model deployments, jobs, and the underlying Compute\n   and storage infrastructure is provisioned and maintained for you.\nYou pay for the use of the underlying infrastructure (Block Storage, Compute, and Object\n   Storage). Review the detailed pricing list for Data Science\n   resources.\nYou only pay for the infrastructure while you are using it with Data Science resources:\n\nNotebook Sessions\n\n\n\nNotebook sessions are serverless, and all underlying infrastructure is\n        service-managed.\n\n\nWhen creating a notebook session, you select the VM shape (the type of machine CPU or GPU,\n        and the number of OCPU or GPUs) and amount of block storage (minimum of 50 GB).\n\nWhile a notebook session is active, you pay for Compute and Block Storage at the standard\n       Oracle Cloud Infrastructure rates, see Deactivating Notebook Sessions.\n\nYou can deactivate your notebook session, which shuts down the Compute though retains the\n        Block Storage. In this case, you are no longer charged for Compute, but you continue to pay\n        for the Block Storage. This applies to notebook sessions with a GPU instance. Notebook\n        sessions with a GPU instance aren't metered for Compute when they are deactivated.\nYou can activate your notebook session to reattach this Block Storage to new Compute, see\n         Deactivating and Activating Notebook Sessions.\n\n\nWhen you delete a notebook session, you are no longer charged for Compute or Block\n        Storage, see Deleting Notebook Sessions.\n\n\n\nModels\n\n\n\nWhen you save a model to the model catalog, you are charged for the storage of the model\n        artifact at the standard Object Storage rates in terms of GB per month.\n\n\nWhen you delete a model, you are no longer charged, see Deleting Models.\n\n\n\nModel Deployments\n\n\n\nWhen you deploy a model, you select the shape type and the number of replicas hosting the\n        model servers. You can also select the load balancer bandwidth associated with your\n        deployment.\n\n\nWhen a model deployment is active, you pay for the VMs that are hosting the model servers\n        and the load balancer at the standard OCI rates.\n\n\nWhen you deactivate a model deployment, you are no longer charged for the VMs or the load\n        balancer. You can activate a model deployment and billing resumes for both VMs and the load\n        balancer.\n\n\nWhen you stop a model deployment, you are no longer charged for the infrastructure\n        associated with the model deployment.\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nJobs don't render a premium cost for using the service, you only pay for the underlining\n        used infrastructure and only during the duration of execution of the job artifact. \n\n\nMetering starts from the moment the job artifact is run, and stops with the code exit. You\n        don't pay for the infrastructure provisioning time nor for the deprovisioning of the\n        infrastructure. \nMetering includes the CPU or GPU consumption per OCPU during the duration of running the\n        job artifact  and the Block Storage size used for the job. \n\n\nUsing the Logging service with Jobs doesn't incur an extray cost.\n\n\n\nPipelines\n\n\n\nPipelines are billed by the usage of the underlying Compute and Block Storage that the pipeline uses to execute the pipeline step code.\n\n\nThere is no additional charge for the orchestration or artifact storage.\n\n\n\n\n Tip\nYou can use Checking Your Balance and Usage to review the costs\n    associated with your account.

ADS has many functions and objects that automates or simplifies the steps in the Data Science workflow, including connecting to data, exploring and visualizing data, training a model with AutoML, evaluating models, and explaining models. In addition, ADS provides a simple interface to access the Data Science service model catalog and other OCI services including Object Storage. To familiarize yourself with ADS, see the Accelerated Data Science Library.\n\nProjects\n\nProjects are collaborative workspaces for organizing and documenting Data Science assets, such as notebook sessions and models.\n\nNotebook Sessions\n\nData Science notebook sessions are interactive coding environments for building and training models. Notebook sessions come with many preinstalled open source and Oracle developed machine learning and data science packages.\n\nConda Environments\n\nConda is an open-source environment and package management system and was created for\n            Python programs. It quickly installs, runs, and updates packages and their dependencies.\n            Conda easily creates, saves, loads, and switches between environments on your local\n            computer.\n\nModels\n\nModels define a mathematical representation of your data and business process. The\n            model catalog is a place to store, track, share, and manage models.\n\nModel Deployments\n\nModel deployments are a managed resource in the Data Science service that allows you to deploy models stored in the model catalog as HTTP endpoints. Deploying machine learning models as web applications (HTTP API endpoints) serving predictions in real time is the most common way to productionized models. HTTP endpoints are flexible and can serve requests for model predictions. \n\nJobs\n\nData Science jobs enable you to define and run repeatable machine learning tasks on a fully-managed infrastructure.\n\nPipelines\n\nA Data Science pipeline is an executable construct that describes an end-to-end machine learning orchestration that can be executed in a repeatable way.\n\nLogs\n\nIntegrate the Logging service into Data Science to create and manage custom logs.\n\nMetrics\n\nMonitor the health, capacity, and performance of some Data Science resources using metrics, alarms, and notifications.\n\n\nYou should also be familiar with the OCI Key Concepts.\n"

When you create Data Science\n   resources, such as notebook sessions, models, model deployments, jobs, and the underlying Compute\n   and storage infrastructure is provisioned and maintained for you.\nYou pay for the use of the underlying infrastructure (Block Storage, Compute, and Object\n   Storage). Review the detailed pricing list for Data Science\n   resources.\nYou only pay for the infrastructure while you are using it with Data Science resources:\n\nNotebook Sessions\n\n\n\nNotebook sessions are serverless, and all underlying infrastructure is\n        service-managed.\n\n\nWhen creating a notebook session, you select the VM shape (the type of machine CPU or GPU,\n        and the number of OCPU or GPUs) and amount of block storage (minimum of 50 GB).\n\nWhile a notebook session is active, you pay for Compute and Block Storage at the standard\n       Oracle Cloud Infrastructure rates, see Deactivating Notebook Sessions.\n\nYou can deactivate your notebook session, which shuts down the Compute though retains the\n        Block Storage. In this case, you are no longer charged for Compute, but you continue to pay\n        for the Block Storage. This applies to notebook sessions with a GPU instance. Notebook\n        sessions with a GPU instance aren't metered for Compute when they are deactivated.\nYou can activate your notebook session to reattach this Block Storage to new Compute, see\n         Deactivating and Activating Notebook Sessions.\n\n\nWhen you delete a notebook session, you are no longer charged for Compute or Block\n        Storage, see Deleting Notebook Sessions.\n\n\n\nModels\n\n\n\nWhen you save a model to the model catalog, you are charged for the storage of the model\n        artifact at the standard Object Storage rates in terms of GB per month.\n\n\nWhen you delete a model, you are no longer charged, see Deleting Models.\n\n\n\nModel Deployments\n\n\n\nWhen you deploy a model, you select the shape type and the number of replicas hosting the\n        model servers. You can also select the load balancer bandwidth associated with your\n        deployment.\n\n\nWhen a model deployment is active, you pay for the VMs that are hosting the model servers\n        and the load balancer at the standard OCI rates.\n\n\nWhen you deactivate a model deployment, you are no longer charged for the VMs or the load\n        balancer. You can activate a model deployment and billing resumes for both VMs and the load\n        balancer.\n\n\nWhen you stop a model deployment, you are no longer charged for the infrastructure\n        associated with the model deployment.\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nJobs don't render a premium cost for using the service, you only pay for the underlining\n        used infrastructure and only during the duration of execution of the job artifact. \n\n\nMetering starts from the moment the job artifact is run, and stops with the code exit. You\n        don't pay for the infrastructure provisioning time nor for the deprovisioning of the\n        infrastructure. \nMetering includes the CPU or GPU consumption per OCPU during the duration of running the\n        job artifact  and the Block Storage size used for the job. \n\n\nUsing the Logging service with Jobs doesn't incur an extray cost.\n\n\n\nPipelines\n\n\n\nPipelines are billed by the usage of the underlying Compute and Block Storage that the pipeline uses to execute the pipeline step code.\n\n\nThere is no additional charge for the orchestration or artifact storage.\n\n\n\n\n Tip\nYou can use Checking Your Balance and Usage to review the costs\n    associated with your account.

This storage is persistent from session to session, but after 6-months of non-use, the administrator for your tenancy will receive a notification that the storage will be removed in 60 days. Starting a cloud shell session resets the storage removal timer.\nCloud Shell does not support mounting additional storage.\nCloud Shell does not scan user files for malware or viruses.\nCloud Shell sessions do not allow for any incoming connections, and there is no\n                public IP address available.\nThe OCI CLI will execute commands against the region selected in the Console's Region selection menu when the Cloud Shell was started. Changing the region selection in the console will not change the region for existing Cloud Shell instances; you will need to open a new Cloud Shell instance to change regions.\nCloud Shell sessions have a maximum length of 24 hours, and time out after 60\n                minutes of inactivity.\n\nCloud Shell uses websockets to communicate between your browser and the service.\n                    If your browser has websockets disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has\n                    websockets disabled you will see an error message (\"An unexpected error\n                    occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud Shell from the console.\n\nCloud Shell is designed for interactive use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Users who need additional storage for Cloud Shell or want to run non-interactive long-running tasks are encouraged to use Compute and Storage resources in their tenancy.\nFor maximum compatibility, Cloud Shell includes Python version 2 and Python version\n                3. Python 2 is the default that will run when you enter 'python' at the command\n                line. To run Python 3, enter 'python3' at the command line.\nThe following reserved words can't be used as the user name for a Cloud Shell user: oci, root, bin, daemon, adm, lp, sync, shutdown, halt, mai, operator, games, ftp, nobody, oci, systemd-network, dbus, polkitd, tss, and apache. Attempting to create a Cloud Shell session when logged in with a user name (or the part of the name before the @ sign if the user name is an email address)\u00c2\u00a0that is one of these reserved words will result in an \"Unexpected Error\" message.\nEntirely numerical user names (for example, \"1234\")\u00c2\u00a0are not supported by Cloud Shell.\nThe Cloud Shell session time zone is UTC, and cannot be changed.\nCloud Shell does not allow root access or the use of sudo, so packages that require\n                root access for installation can't be installed. Many packages are available in\n                versions that do not require root for installation; you can unpack and install these\n                in your home directory. \nCloud Shell does not allow the use of ping, since ping requires root access.\nCloud Shell boots in FIPS mode, which might affect the behavior of some commands.\nCloud Shell cannot generate PKCS#1 keys when using the openssl command, because Cloud Shell boots in FIPS mode. FIPS mode requires that Cloud Shell generates PKCS#8 keys.\nFor more information on Cloud Shell limits, see the Cloud Shell section in Service Limits. \n\nCloud Shell Access and Other Restrictions\nYou can access OCI resources from Cloud Shell according to the policies granted by\n                your tenancy administrator.

Note that an API gateway must be able to reach the back ends defined in the API\u00c2\u00a0deployment specification. For example, if the back end is on the public internet, the VCN must have an internet gateway to enable the API gateway to route requests to the back end.\n\nThe VCN must have a set of DHCP options that includes an appropriate DNS resolver to map host names defined in an API deployment specification to IP addresses. If such a DHCP\u00c2\u00a0options set does not exist in the VCN\u00c2\u00a0already, you will have to create it. Select the DHCP\u00c2\u00a0options set for the API gateway's subnet as follows:\n\nIf the host name is publicly published on the internet, or if the host name belongs to an instance in the same VCN, select a DHCP options set that has the Oracle-provided Internet and VCN\u00c2\u00a0Resolver as the  DNS\u00c2\u00a0Type. This is the default if you do not explicitly select a DHCP\u00c2\u00a0options set.\nIf the host name is  on your own private or internal network (for example, connected to the VCN by FastConnect), select a DHCP options set  that has Custom\u00c2\u00a0Resolver as the  DNS\u00c2\u00a0Type, and has the URL\u00c2\u00a0of a suitable DNS server that can resolve the host name to an IP address.\nNote that you can change the DNS\u00c2\u00a0server details in the DHCP options set specified for an API gateway's subnet. The API\u00c2\u00a0gateway will be reconfigured to use the updated DNS server details within two hours. For more information about  resolving host names to IP\u00c2\u00a0addresses, see  DNS in Your Virtual Cloud Network and DHCP Options.\n\nWithin your tenancy, there must already be a compartment to own API Gateway-related resources (API gateways, API deployments). This compartment can be, but need not be, the same compartment that contains the network resources. See Create Compartments to Own Network Resources and API Gateway Resources in the Tenancy, if they don't exist already. Note that the API Gateway-related resources can reside in the root compartment. However, if you expect multiple teams to create API\u00c2\u00a0gateways, best practice is to create a separate compartment  for each team.\n\nTo create API gateways and deploy APIs on them, you must belong to one of the following:\n\nThe tenancy's Administrators group.\n\nA group to which policies grant the appropriate permissions on network and API Gateway-related resources.  See Create Policies to Control Access to Network and API Gateway-Related Resources.\n\n\nPolicies must be defined to give the API gateways you create\u00c2\u00a0access to additional resources, if necessary.

        "text": "oracle cloud infrastructure, oci, Adding mTLS support to API Deployments service, \n \nThe API gateways you create with the API Gateway service are secured through TLS encryption and verification. An API gateway presents a server certificate to an API client during a TLS handshake, enabling the API client to validate the authenticity of the API gateway. The process of the API client authenticating the API gateway is known as one-way TLS.\nIn many situations, you only want to allow authenticated API clients to access an API. In these situations, you want the API gateway to validate the authenticity of an API client, by verifying the TLS certificate presented by the API client. The process of the API gateway authenticating the API client is known as mutual TLS (mTLS).\nWith mTLS, both the API gateway and the API client exchange and verify certificates during the TLS handshake. The API gateway verifies the TLS certificate presented by the API client using custom Certificate Authority (CA) root certificates, and custom CA bundles of root and intermediate certificates. The custom CAs and CA bundles are stored in the API gateway's trust store, along with a default CA bundle that contains certificates of well-known public CAs. Note that in an mTLS handshake, the API gateway only uses custom CAs and custom CA bundles to verify API client certificates. The API gateway does not use the default CA bundle to verify API client certificates. So if you want an API gateway to support mTLS, you must add custom CAs and CA bundles to the API gateway's trust store (see Customizing Trust Stores for TLS Certificate Verification).\nFor extra control, you can also specify that certificates presented by API clients to an API gateway must contain particular values in the certificate's Email  Address, URL, or Domain Name fields. If you specify values for these fields when setting up mTLS for an API gateway, the API gateway will reject requests from API clients presenting certificates that do not contain them. If you don't specify values for these fields when setting up mTLS, the API gateway will accept all requests from API clients providing the certificate is valid. You can specify up to 10 values for each API deployment.\nAfter a successful mTLS handshake between the API gateway and an API client, a Base64-encoded version of the certificate presented by the API client is saved in the request.cert context table as a context variable named request.cert[client_base64]. When defining an API deployment, you can reference the certificate using the format ${request.cert[client_base64]} (see Adding Context Variables to Policies and HTTP Back End Definitions). Note that if an API client presents a TLS certificate that is greater than 8 KB in size (after it has been Base64-encoded), the certificate is not saved as a context variable.\nYou use a request policy in the API deployment specification to add mTLS support to an API  (see Adding Request Policies and Response Policies to API Deployment Specifications). The mTLS request policy applies globally to all routes in an API deployment specification.\nNote the following:\nIf an API client presents a TLS certificate to an API gateway and the API deployment is not mTLS-enabled, the API gateway simply ignores the TLS certificate that has been presented. The request.cert[client_base64] context variable is not set in this situation.\nIf an API gateway is unable to validate the TLS certificate presented by an API client, the API gateway rejects the request with an HTTP 401 error status response code.\nIf an API gateway uses a custom CA bundle to validate the TLS certificate presented by an API client, no more than three CA certificates can be traversed at any point in the certificate chain during validation. In other words, to be valid, a CA certificate in the chain must either itself be signed directly by a custom CA present in the API gateway's trust store, or be no more than two intermediate certificates away from a certificate that has been signed by such a custom CA. Contact us if you want to allow more intermediate certificates.\n\nYou can add an mTLS request policy to an API deployment specification by:\n\nusing the Console\nediting a JSON\u00c2\u00a0file\n\n"

The server responds with the methods it will allow in an actual request. The web browser only sends the actual request if the response from the server indicates that the methods in the actual request are allowed. The CORS standard also enables servers to notify clients whether requests can include credentials (cookies, authorization headers, or TLS\u00c2\u00a0client certificates).\nFor more information about CORS, see resources available online including those from W3C and Mozilla. \nUsing the API Gateway service, you can enable CORS\n            support in the APIs you deploy to API\u00c2\u00a0gateways. When you enable CORS support in an API\n            deployment, HTTP pre-flight requests and actual requests to the API deployment return\n            one or more CORS response headers to the API client. You set the CORS response header\n            values in the API deployment specification.\nYou use request policies to add CORS support to APIs (see Adding Request Policies and Response Policies to API Deployment Specifications). You can apply a CORS request policy globally to all routes in an API deployment specification, or just to particular routes. \nYou can add a CORS request policy to an API deployment specification by:\n\nusing the Console\nediting a JSON\u00c2\u00a0file\n\n"

To prevent invalid requests being sent to\n            back-end services, you can use an API\u00c2\u00a0gateway to validate incoming requests against a\n            validation request policy. If a request does not meet the validation policy\n            requirements, you can configure the API gateway to reject the request instead of passing\n            it through to the targeted back-end service. Instead, the API gateway sends a 4xx error\n            code response to the API client that sent the request.\n Using an API gateway, you can set up validation request policies to check that :\n\nthe request includes specific headers\nthe request includes specific query parameters\nthe request body is of a specific content type\n\nYou can control how an API gateway applies a validation request policy by specifying a\n            validation mode for the policy:\n\nIn Enforcing mode, the API gateway validates all requests against the validation\n                request policy. The API gateway only sends requests that pass validation to the\n                back-end service. The API gateway does not send requests that fail validation to the\n                back-end service. The API gateway sends a 4xx error code response to an API client\n                sending a request that fails validation. The API gateway includes entries in\n                execution logs for validation errors. \nIn Permissive mode, the API gateway validates all requests against the validation\n                request policy. The API gateway sends all requests to the back-end service,\n                regardless of whether they pass or fail validation. Note that requests that fail\n                validation are still sent to the back-end service.  The API gateway includes entries\n                in execution logs for validation errors. Use\n                the Permissive mode to assess the likely impact of applying a validation request\n                policy to a system already in production system, without affecting API clients\n                currently sending requests.\nIn Disabled mode, the API gateway does not validate any requests against the\n                validation request policy. The API gateway sends all requests to the back-end\n                service.\n\nThe API gateway applies validation request policies after CORS request policies, and\n            after authentication and authorization request policies, but before transformation\n            request policies.\nYou can add validation request policies to an API deployment specification by:\n\nusing the Console\nediting a JSON file\n\n"

Alternatively, you can have the API gateway itself validate the tokens included in a request (as described in Validating Tokens to Add Authentication and Authorization to API Deployments).\nYou can add authentication and authorization functionality to API\u00c2\u00a0gateways by writing an 'authorizer function' that: \n\nProcesses request attributes to verify the identity of an API client with an identity provider.\nDetermines the operations that the API client is allowed to perform.\nReturns the operations the API client is allowed to perform as a list of 'access scopes' (an 'access scope' is an arbitrary string used to determine access).\nOptionally returns a key-value pair for use by the API deployment. For example, as a context variable for use in an HTTP back end definition (see Adding Context Variables to Policies and HTTP Back End Definitions).\n\nDepending on the functionality you require, you can write:\n\n(Recommended) A multi-argument authorizer function that accepts a user-defined, multi-argument access token comprising one or more elements of a request (see Creating a Multi-Argument Authorizer Function (Recommended)). Note that multi-argument authorizer functions can accept single access tokens contained in a request header or query parameter.\nA single-argument authorizer function that accepts a single-argument access token comprising a single value contained in a request header or query parameter in a request (see Creating a Single-Argument Authorizer Function).\n\nUsing a multi-argument (rather than a single-argument) authorizer function enables an API gateway to perform finer-grained, request-based authentication. A multi-argument authorizer function can query decision services and policy agents with attributes from the access token and with other request elements such as query parameters, hostname, and subdomain. \n Note Oracle recommends the use of multi-argument authorizer functions rather than single-argument authorizer functions because of their additional versatility. Single-argument authorizer functions were provided in earlier releases, and continue to be supported. However, since multi-argument authorizer functions can also accept single-argument access tokens contained in request headers and query parameter, there is no reason to create new single-argument authorizer functions. Furthermore, single-argument authorizer functions are planned for deprecation in a future release.\nHaving written the authorizer function, you can then deploy it to OCI Functions (see Deploying an Authorizer Function). \nFor a related Developer Tutorial containing an example single-argument authorizer function, see Functions: Validate an API Key with API Gateway.\nHaving deployed the authorizer function, you enable authentication and authorization for an API\u00c2\u00a0deployment by including two different kinds of request policy in the API deployment specification:\n\nAn authentication request policy for the entire API deployment that specifies:\n                \nThe OCID of the authorizer function that you deployed to OCI Functions that will perform authentication and authorization.\nThe request attributes to pass to the authorizer function.\nWhether unauthenticated API clients can access routes in the API\u00c2\u00a0deployment.\nAn authorization request policy for each route that specifies the operations an API client is allowed to perform, based on the API client's access scopes as returned by the authorizer function.\n\nYou can add authentication and authorization request policies to an API deployment specification by:\n\nUsing the Console.\nEditing a JSON\u00c2\u00a0file.\n\n Tip\nTo help troubleshoot issues with the authorizer function, consider adding an\n                execution log to the API deployment, with its log level set to Info (see Adding Logging to API Deployments).\nTo see details in the log files related to authentication and authorization, search for customAuth.\n\n"

If the TLS\u00c2\u00a0certificate used by an API\u00c2\u00a0gateway expires, calls to an API deployed on the API\u00c2\u00a0gateway might be marked as insecure by the API client (for example, by a browser or by the curl command line tool) and blocked. To avoid blocked calls, you have to renew TLS certificates before they expire (sometimes referred to as 'rotating' certificates).\nIf the API Gateway service obtained the original TLS certificate for you, the API Gateway service automatically renews the TLS\u00c2\u00a0certificate with the Oracle-designated Certificate Authority before it expires. However, if you obtained a custom TLS certificate yourself, you are responsible for renewing the custom TLS\u00c2\u00a0certificate with your chosen Certificate Authority before it expires. When you request the renewal of a TLS\u00c2\u00a0certificate, the Certificate Authority returns a completely new TLS\u00c2\u00a0certificate. \nThe procedure for renewing a custom TLS certificate used by API gateways depends on whether you've created API Gateway certificate resources or Certificates service certificate resources.\nRenewing custom TLS certificates for API Gateway certificate resources\nWhen you've created an API Gateway certificate resource used by an API gateway, you cannot simply update the existing API Gateway certificate resource with the new TLS certificate. Instead, you create a new API Gateway certificate resource, add the new TLS\u00c2\u00a0certificate to the new certificate resource, and then update any API gateways that used the previous certificate resource to use the new certificate resource.\n To renew the custom TLS\u00c2\u00a0certificate used by an API\u00c2\u00a0gateway:\n\n\nSubmit a TLS certificate renewal request to the Certificate Authority from which you originally obtained the TLS certificate. The exact steps to renew a TLS\u00c2\u00a0certificate depend on the Certificate Authority you use, so always refer to the Certificate Authority documentation for more detailed information.\nWhen you create the certificate renewal request, a public key is added to the request, and a corresponding private key is also generated and stored in a local file. You'll use this private key when you set up the new API Gateway certificate resource, so make a note of its location.\nThe Certificate Authority returns a file containing the new custom TLS certificate, and typically one or more files containing intermediate certificates forming a certificate chain from the TLS\u00c2\u00a0certificate back to the Certificate Authority.\n\nCreate a new API Gateway certificate resource and add to it the new TLS\u00c2\u00a0certificate, any intermediate certificates, and the new private key (see Step 2: Create an API Gateway certificate resource).\nUpdate all the existing API gateways that used the original API Gateway certificate resource to use the new API Gateway certificate resource (see Updating API Gateways and API Deployments).\nWhen there are no API\u00c2\u00a0gateways still using the original API Gateway certificate resource, delete the original certificate resource:\nIf using the Console: On the Certificates page, click the Actions icon (three dots) beside the original API Gateway certificate resource you want to delete, and then click Delete.\nIf using the CLI: Use the following command to delete the original API Gateway certificate resource:oci api-gateway certificate delete --certificate-id <certificate-ocid>\nNote that you cannot delete an API Gateway certificate resource if there are API\u00c2\u00a0gateways still using it.\n\n\nRenewing custom TLS certificates for Certificates service certificate resources\nWhen you've created a Certificates service certificate resource used by an API gateway, you can use the Certificates service to renew the TLS certificate by creating a new certificate version.

        "text": "oracle cloud infrastructure, oci, Adding Multiple Authentication Servers to the same API Deployment service, \n \nA common requirement is to authenticate requests sent to the same API deployment in different ways. For example, you might want an incoming request from one API client to be sent to an authorizer function for authentication. Whereas, you might want a JSON\u00c2\u00a0Web Token (JWT) included in an incoming request from a different API client to be validated with an identity provider. For convenience, these different types of authentication and authorization (authorizer function, JWT authentication) are referred to as 'authentication servers'.\nTo meet the requirement to authenticate requests sent to an API deployment in different ways, you can define multiple authentication servers for the same API deployment. The authentication servers you set up can be of the same type or a different type. You can specify the following types of authentication server:\nauthorizer functions (for more information about authorizer functions, see Passing Tokens to Authorizer Functions to Add Authentication and Authorization to API Deployments)\nJSON\u00c2\u00a0Web Tokens (JWTs) validated with an identity provider (see Validating Tokens to Add Authentication and Authorization to API Deployments).\n\nWhen defining multiple authentication servers for the same API deployment, you create rules to enable the API gateway to dynamically select which authentication server to use to authenticate requests, based on an element in the original request.\nTo enable the API gateway to dynamically select the correct authentication server, you use the following context variables to capture elements of the request:\n\nrequest.auth[<key>] where <key> is the name of a claim contained in a JWT token. \nrequest.headers[<key>] where <key> is the name of a header included in the request to the API.\nrequest.host as the name of the host to which the original request was sent.\nrequest.path[<key>] where <key> is the name of a path parameter defined in the API deployment specification.\nrequest.query[<key>] where <key> is the name of a query parameter included in the request to the API.\nrequest.subdomain[<key>] where <key> is the trailing part of the host name to ignore when capturing the leading part of the host name to which the original request was sent. \n\nNote that if a context variable has multiple values, only the first value is used when selecting the authentication server. For more information about context variables, see Adding Context Variables to Policies and HTTP Back End Definitions.\nYou can set up multiple authentication servers for the same API deployment in an API deployment specification by:\n\nUsing the Console.\nEditing a JSON\u00c2\u00a0file.\n\nNotes about authentication server rule matching\nWhen creating the rules to determine which authentication server to use, you can specify how closely the context variable value must match a given value for the request to be routed to a particular authentication server. You can require an exact match, or you can specify a value starting with, or ending with, a wildcard. The API gateway evaluates the rules in the order you specify (exact match rules first, followed by wildcard rules), and uses the first matching rule. You can also specify a default rule to use if the context variable value does not match any authentication server rules. If no rule is specified as the default and the context variable value in an incoming request does not match any authentication server rules, the request returns an error. The order of precedence for determining which authentication server rule (and hence which authentication server) to use can be summarized as:\n\nIf the context variable value exactly matches a rule's value, use that rule.\nOtherwise, if the context variable value matches a rule's value that starts or ends with a wildcard, use the first rule containing a wildcard that matches.\nOtherwise, if a rule is specified as the default rule, use that rule.\nOtherwise, return a 401 Unauthorized error response.\n\n\n"

        "text": "oracle cloud infrastructure, oci, Cloud Shell service, \n Cloud Shell Limitations, \nKeep the following limitations in mind when using Cloud Shell:\n\nCloud Shell comes with 5GB\u00c2\u00a0of storage for the VM's home directory. This storage is persistent from session to session, but after 6-months of non-use, the administrator for your tenancy will receive a notification that the storage will be removed in 60 days. Starting a cloud shell session resets the storage removal timer.\nCloud Shell does not support mounting additional storage.\nCloud Shell does not scan user files for malware or viruses.\nCloud Shell sessions do not allow for any incoming connections, and there is no\n                public IP address available.\nThe OCI CLI will execute commands against the region selected in the Console's Region selection menu when the Cloud Shell was started. Changing the region selection in the console will not change the region for existing Cloud Shell instances; you will need to open a new Cloud Shell instance to change regions.\nCloud Shell sessions have a maximum length of 24 hours, and time out after 60\n                minutes of inactivity.\n\nCloud Shell uses websockets to communicate between your browser and the service.\n                    If your browser has websockets disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has\n                    websockets disabled you will see an error message (\"An unexpected error\n                    occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud Shell from the console.\n\nCloud Shell is designed for interactive use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Users who need additional storage for Cloud Shell or want to run non-interactive long-running tasks are encouraged to use Compute and Storage resources in their tenancy.\nFor maximum compatibility, Cloud Shell includes Python version 2 and Python version\n                3. Python 2 is the default that will run when you enter 'python' at the command\n                line. To run Python 3, enter 'python3' at the command line.\nThe following reserved words can't be used as the user name for a Cloud Shell user: oci, root, bin, daemon, adm, lp, sync, shutdown, halt, mai, operator, games, ftp, nobody, oci, systemd-network, dbus, polkitd, tss, and apache. Attempting to create a Cloud Shell session when logged in with a user name (or the part of the name before the @ sign if the user name is an email address)\u00c2\u00a0that is one of these reserved words will result in an \"Unexpected Error\" message.\nEntirely numerical user names (for example, \"1234\")\u00c2\u00a0are not supported by Cloud Shell.\nThe Cloud Shell session time zone is UTC, and cannot be changed.\nCloud Shell does not allow root access or the use of sudo, so packages that require\n                root access for installation can't be installed. Many packages are available in\n                versions that do not require root for installation; you can unpack and install these\n                in your home directory. \nCloud Shell does not allow the use of ping, since ping requires root access.\nCloud Shell boots in FIPS mode, which might affect the behavior of some commands.\nCloud Shell cannot generate PKCS#1 keys when using the openssl command, because Cloud Shell boots in FIPS mode. FIPS mode requires that Cloud Shell generates PKCS#8 keys.\nFor more information on Cloud Shell limits, see the Cloud Shell section in Service Limits. \n\nCloud Shell Access and Other Restrictions\nYou can access OCI resources from Cloud Shell according to the policies granted by\n                your tenancy administrator. There is no additional access because you're using Cloud\n                Shell, and Cloud Shell does not provide any additional access to your tenancy, or\n                private resources in your tenancy VCNs. Note Cloud Shell uses websockets to\n                    communicate between your browser and the service. If your browser has websockets\n                    disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has websockets disabled you will see an\n                    error message (\"An unexpected error occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud\n                    Shell from the console.\nWhile Cloud Shell provides access to the internet, there is no ingress from the\n                outside world into Cloud Shell (for example: you cannot ssh in to Cloud Shell) and\n                no public IP address available. If your tenancy admin does not want to enable access\n                to the internet from OCI, they should not grant access to Cloud Shell with an IAM\n                policy.\n\n"

A\n                    connection is always associated to one data asset. A data asset can have more\n                    than one connection.\nConnection Type\nDefines the different set of properties available in a connection to connect to\n                    a data asset.\nHarvest\nProcess that extracts technical metadata from your connected data sources into\n                    your data catalog repository.\nObject\nAn object in the Data Catalog refers to any object that is managed in your data\n                    catalog such as data assets, data entities, attributes, glossaries, and\n                    terms.\nData Object\nA data object in Data Catalog refers to data assets and data entities.\nData Entity\nA data entity is a collection of data such as a database table or view, or a\n                    single logical file. Typically, a data entity has many attributes that describe\n                    its data.\nFilename Pattern\nA filename pattern is a regular expression that is created to group multiple\n                    Object Storage files into a logical data entity.\nLogical Data Entity\nA logical data entity is a group of Object Storage files that are derived by\n                    creating and assigning filename patterns to a data asset.\nAttribute\nAn attribute describes a data item with a name and data type. For example, a\n                    column in a table or a field in a file.\nCustom Property\nCustom property is created to enrich data catalog objects with business\n                    context.\nGlossary\nA glossary is a collection of business concepts in your company. Glossary\n                    constitutes of categories and business terms.\nCategory\nA category is created in a glossary to group logically related business terms.\n                    You can create a category within a category to group your terms.\nTerm\nTerms are the actual definitions of business concepts as agreed upon by\n                    different business stakeholders in your company. You use terms to organize your\n                    data entities and attributes.\nData Catalog Tag\nTags are free-form labels or keywords you create to be able to logically\n                    identify data objects. Tags help in metadata classification and discovery. You\n                    create tags for data assets, data entities, and attributes. Using tags, you can\n                    search for all data objects tagged with a specific tag name.\nJob\nA task that runs the harvest process. A job can be created and run immediately,\n                    scheduled to run at a specified frequency, or created and run when needed. \nSchedule\nAn automated job that can run hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly.\n\n"

In Data Catalog,\n        you create a private endpoint to configure the private network where your data source is\n        hosted.\n\nBefore you create a private endpoint in Data Catalog, you must have the following\n                details:\n\nThe name of the Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) used to access your data\n                    source.\nThe name of the subnet in the VCN.\nThe list of DNS zones used to resolve the FQDNs or private IPs of the data\n                    sources that you want to harvest.  Important\nIf the data sources in your private network are accessed with FQDNs and\n                            private IPs, you only need the list of all the FQDNs when you create the\n                            private endpoint.\nIf all the data sources in your private network are accessed with private\n                            IPs, then while creating a private endpoint you must specify at least\n                            one resolvable FQDN or DNS. \nFor private autonomous databases, use the FQDN of the database as the DNS\n                            zone. For custom data sources running on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure\n                            compute Virtual Machines (VMs), you can specify the FQDN of the VM, or\n                            the domain name of the subnet in which the VM is provisioned, or the\n                            domain name of the VCN.\n\n\nHere's how you create a private endpoint:\n\n\nOpen the navigation menu and click\n                    Analytics & AI.

You can\n                    create the private endpoint in a different compartment than the compartment\n                    where your data catalog is created.\n\nEnter a name to identify the private endpoint.\n\nSelect the VCN that is created to provide private access to your data\n                    source.\n\nSelect the Subnet that has the private endpoint to access your data\n                    source.\n\nEnter the DNS zones to resolve. The DNS zone can be a DNS domain name or a\n                    FQDN.

This storage is persistent from session to session, but after 6-months of non-use, the administrator for your tenancy will receive a notification that the storage will be removed in 60 days. Starting a cloud shell session resets the storage removal timer.\nCloud Shell does not support mounting additional storage.\nCloud Shell does not scan user files for malware or viruses.\nCloud Shell sessions do not allow for any incoming connections, and there is no\n                public IP address available.\nThe OCI CLI will execute commands against the region selected in the Console's Region selection menu when the Cloud Shell was started. Changing the region selection in the console will not change the region for existing Cloud Shell instances; you will need to open a new Cloud Shell instance to change regions.\nCloud Shell sessions have a maximum length of 24 hours, and time out after 60\n                minutes of inactivity.\n\nCloud Shell uses websockets to communicate between your browser and the service.\n                    If your browser has websockets disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has\n                    websockets disabled you will see an error message (\"An unexpected error\n                    occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud Shell from the console.\n\nCloud Shell is designed for interactive use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Users who need additional storage for Cloud Shell or want to run non-interactive long-running tasks are encouraged to use Compute and Storage resources in their tenancy.\nFor maximum compatibility, Cloud Shell includes Python version 2 and Python version\n                3. Python 2 is the default that will run when you enter 'python' at the command\n                line. To run Python 3, enter 'python3' at the command line.\nThe following reserved words can't be used as the user name for a Cloud Shell user: oci, root, bin, daemon, adm, lp, sync, shutdown, halt, mai, operator, games, ftp, nobody, oci, systemd-network, dbus, polkitd, tss, and apache. Attempting to create a Cloud Shell session when logged in with a user name (or the part of the name before the @ sign if the user name is an email address)\u00c2\u00a0that is one of these reserved words will result in an \"Unexpected Error\" message.\nEntirely numerical user names (for example, \"1234\")\u00c2\u00a0are not supported by Cloud Shell.\nThe Cloud Shell session time zone is UTC, and cannot be changed.\nCloud Shell does not allow root access or the use of sudo, so packages that require\n                root access for installation can't be installed. Many packages are available in\n                versions that do not require root for installation; you can unpack and install these\n                in your home directory. \nCloud Shell does not allow the use of ping, since ping requires root access.\nCloud Shell boots in FIPS mode, which might affect the behavior of some commands.\nCloud Shell cannot generate PKCS#1 keys when using the openssl command, because Cloud Shell boots in FIPS mode. FIPS mode requires that Cloud Shell generates PKCS#8 keys.\nFor more information on Cloud Shell limits, see the Cloud Shell section in Service Limits. \n\nCloud Shell Access and Other Restrictions\nYou can access OCI resources from Cloud Shell according to the policies granted by\n                your tenancy administrator. There is no additional access because you're using Cloud\n                Shell, and Cloud Shell does not provide any additional access to your tenancy, or\n                private resources in your tenancy VCNs. Note Cloud Shell uses websockets to\n                    communicate between your browser and the service. If your browser has websockets\n                    disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has websockets disabled you will see an\n                    error message (\"An unexpected error occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud\n                    Shell from the console.\nWhile Cloud Shell provides access to the internet, there is no ingress from the\n                outside world into Cloud Shell (for example: you cannot ssh in to Cloud Shell) and\n                no public IP address available.

Each message is processed independently.\nproducer\nA client which sends messages to the queue.\nconsumer\nA client which receives messages from a queue. The consumer is also responsible for deleting messages from the queue after the messages are received.\nmaximum retention period\nThe length of time that a queue retains a message until the message is automatically deleted by the system, if not deleted by a consumer. Maximum retention period is configurable to values of 10 seconds to 7 days at the queue level. The default value is 1 day.\ndelivery count\nThe number of times that a message is delivered to a consumer upon request.\nmaximum delivery attempts\nThe number of times that a message is delivered to a consumer, but not updated or deleted, before it is sent to a dead letter queue (DLQ). Maximum delivery attempts is configurable to values of 1-20 at the queue level. For more information, see delivery count.\npolling timeout\nThe length of time that a consumer will wait for messages to consume. Increasing the polling timeout reduces the number of times a consumer requests messages from the queue but the response indicates that there are no available messages to consume. Polling timeout is configurable to values of 0 to 30 seconds at the queue level, and consumers can set the value when requesting messages. The default value is 30 seconds. For more information, see long polling.\nvisibility timeout\nThe length of time during which a message received from the queue by one consumer isn't visible to other consumers. Visibility timeout is configurable to values of 1 second to 12 hours at the queue level, and consumers can set the value when requesting messages. The default value is 30 seconds.

        "text": "oracle cloud infrastructure, oci, Consuming Messages service, \n Learn how to consume messages from a queue.\nConsuming messages requires permissions to the queue and access to its Messages endpoint. \nA response to a GetMessages request contains the list of messages with their payload, message ID, expiration time, visibility timeout, delivery count, and a receipt. The maximum number of messages that can be returned in one response is 20, but the actual number of messages returned depends on the number of available messages and whether or not the request used long polling. \nConsumers are responsible for updating messages and deleting messages, which require the message's receipt.\nMessage locking\nConsumers are able to \"lock\" a message retrieved from the queue so that another consumer cannot retrieve the same message. Messages are locked by specifying a visibility timeout. The Queue API uses the visibilityInSeconds parameter to set this value.\nThe visibility timeout can be set at the queue level when creating a queue, or it can be specified when consuming or updating messages. If a consumer is having difficulty successfully processing a message, it can update the message to extend its invisibility. If a message's visibility timeout is not extended, and the consumer does not delete the message, it returns to the queue.\nWhen consuming, you don't need to specify the visibility timeout. The visibility timeout configured for the queue applies to your request. When creating a queue, the default visibility timeout is 30 seconds. If you include the optional visibility timeout parameter in your request, you can specify a minimum value of 0 seconds and a maximum value of 12 hours.\nUsing a visibility timeout of 0 effectively acts as a peek functionality. Messages retrieved this way will most likely be delivered to another consumer, because their visibility won't change.\n\nDelivery count\nEach time a message is retrieved using a GetMessages request, or by Console polling, its delivery count increases. If the delivery count exceeds the queue's configured maximum, the message is sent to the dead letter queue.\n\nLong polling\nBy default, a GetMessages request uses long polling. The request waits for messages for 30 seconds, and if the timeout passes and no messages are available for consumption, the request returns an empty response. Long polling is useful to prevent tight loop retries on empty responses.\nConsumers can modify this behavior by including the timeoutInSeconds parameter in their request, which accepts values of 0 to 30 seconds. Setting the timeoutInSeconds value to 0 results in an immediate response from the queue, whether or not there are messages available.\n\nUsing the Console\nYou cannot use the Console to consume messages, but you can use the Console to poll for messages. Polling messages serves as a peek at the queue. Messages polled by the Console are unavailable to other consumers until the visibility timeout passes.\n Caution Polling increases the delivery count value for the message. Depending on your dead letter queue settings, this could remove the message from your queue and send it to your dead letter queue.\n\nOpen the navigation menu and click Developer Services.

If your browser has websockets\n                    disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has websockets disabled you will see an\n                    error message (\"An unexpected error occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud\n                    Shell from the console.\nWhile Cloud Shell provides access to the internet, there is no ingress from the\n                outside world into Cloud Shell (for example: you cannot ssh in to Cloud Shell) and\n                no public IP address available. If your tenancy admin does not want to enable access\n                to the internet from OCI, they should not grant access to Cloud Shell with an IAM\n                policy.\n\n"

For more\n                    information, see VCN Cross-Region Peering.  Note A subnet chosen for a Cloudshell Private Network\n                            must have at least one non-reserved IP address for the subnet's CIDR\n                            block available.

As with any Docker image, the instructions to build the\n            image are contained in a Dockerfile. \nIf the function is written in one of the languages supported by an Fn Project FDK\n            (Functions Development Kit), OCI Functions uses\n            the  runtime:, build_image: and\n                run_image: settings in a func.yaml file to determine the language\n            (and therefore the build-time and run-time dependencies) to include in the Docker image.\n            If you use the fn init command to initialize the function, a func.yaml\n            file is created for you. For example, a func.yaml might look like:\nschema_version: 20180708\nname: hello-java\nversion: 0.0.1\nruntime: java\nbuild_image: fnproject/fn-java-fdk-build:jdk11-1.0.116\nrun_image: fnproject/fn-java-fdk:jre11-1.0.116\ncmd: com.example.fn.HelloFunction::handleRequest\nWhen you build or deploy the function, OCI Functions uses the settings in the func.yaml\n            file to create a temporary Dockerfile containing the instructions from which to build\n            the Docker image. For example, a temporary Dockerfile is shown below.\nFROM fnproject/fn-java-fdk-build:jdk11-1.0.116 as build-stage\nWORKDIR /function\nENV MAVEN_OPTS -Dhttp.proxyHost= -Dhttp.proxyPort= -Dhttps.proxyHost= -Dhttps.proxyPort= -Dhttp.nonProxyHosts= -Dmaven.repo.local=/usr/share/maven/ref/repository\nADD pom.xml /function/pom.xml\nRUN [\"mvn\", \"package\", \"dependency:copy-dependencies\", \"-DincludeScope=runtime\", \"-DskipTests=true\", \"-Dmdep.prependGroupId=true\", \"-DoutputDirectory=target\", \"--fail-never\"]\nADD src /function/src\nRUN [\"mvn\", \"package\"]\nFROM fnproject/fn-java-fdk:jre11-1.0.116\nWORKDIR /function\nCOPY --from=build-stage /function/target/*.jar /function/app/\nCMD [\"com.example.fn.HelloFunction::handleRequest\"]\nHaving created the Docker image, OCI Functions\n            deletes the temporary Dockerfile.\nIf you want more control over the Docker image that is created, you can modify the\n            Dockerfile that OCI Functions creates.\n            Alternatively, you can create your own Dockerfile entirely from scratch. In both cases,\n            the Dockerfile is referred to as a 'custom Dockerfile'. This workflow is sometimes\n            referred to as Bring-Your-Own-Dockerfile, or BYOD. \nWhen you build or deploy the function, OCI Functions uses the instructions in the\n            custom Dockerfile to build the Docker image.\nTo have OCI Functions use a custom Dockerfile\n            when building a Docker image:\n\n\nMake a copy of the Dockerfile you want to use as a custom Dockerfile.\n\n\nSave the new file to the directory containing the func.yaml file.\n\n\nGive the new file the name Dockerfile.\nNote that you must name the file Dockerfile.\n\n\nOpen the file named Dockerfile in an editor of your choice.\nFor example, the Dockerfile file might contain the following\n                    lines to install the Oracle Instant Client from an oraclelinux:7-slim base\n                    image:\nFROM oraclelinux:7-slim\n\nRUN  yum -y install oracle-release-el7 oracle-nodejs-release-el7 && \\\n     yum-config-manager --disable ol7_developer_EPEL && \\\n     yum -y install oracle-instantclient19.3-basiclite nodejs && \\\n     rm -rf /var/cache/yum\n\nWORKDIR /function\nADD . /function/\nRUN npm install\n\nCMD exec node func.js\n\n\nInclude the following lines in the file named Dockerfile (as\n                    described in Permissions Granted to Containers Running Functions):\ngroupadd --gid 1000 fn && \\\nadduser --uid 1000 --gid fn fn\nFor example:\nFROM oraclelinux:7-slim\n\nRUN  yum -y install oracle-release-el7 oracle-nodejs-release-el7 && \\\n     yum-config-manager --disable ol7_developer_EPEL && \\\n     yum -y install oracle-instantclient19.3-basiclite nodejs && \\\n     rm -rf /var/cache/yum && \\\n     groupadd --gid 1000 fn && \\\n     adduser --uid 1000 --gid fn fn\n\nWORKDIR /function\nADD . /function/\nRUN npm install\n\nCMD exec node func.js\n\n\nSave the file named Dockerfile. You can now use the\n                        Dockerfile file as a custom Dockerfile.\n\n\nIn the func.yaml file, change the value of the runtime:\n                    parameter to runtime: docker.\nFor example, if the func.yaml file contains runtime: java,\n                    change it to runtime: docker.\n\n\nUse the fn build or fn deploy commands to build\n                    or deploy the function.\n\n\nOCI Functions uses the instructions in the custom\n            Dockerfile (the file named Dockerfile) to build the Docker image for\n            the function, and push it to the Docker registry. \n"

If cached versions of the\n            base images were not available, the Fn Project CLI pulled the most recent versions of\n            the base images from Docker Hub. As a result, you could not be certain that the function\n            code was compatible with the language FDK's build-time base image used to build the\n            function executable, or with the runtime base image used to provide the runtime\n            environment.\nYou can continue to build existing functions exactly as before, by not explicitly\n            specifying the version of the language FDK when you build a function. The Fn Project CLI\n            will continue to use cached versions of the FDK's build-time and runtime base images (if\n            available), or pull the most recent versions of the base images from Docker Hub (if\n            cached images are not available). \nStarting with Fn Project CLI version 0.6.7:\n\nIf you explicitly specify the version of the language FDK when you create a\n                function, the Fn Project CLI adds that version as the value of the\n                    build_image: and run_image: parameters in the\n                function's func.yaml file.\nIf you build or deploy a function and the function's func.yaml file does not already\n                contain build_image: and run_image: parameters\n                because it was created with an earlier Fn Project CLI version, the Fn Project CLI\n                adds the parameters to the func.yaml file. The values of the\n                    build_image: and run_image: parameters record\n                the versions of the FDK build-time and runtime base images that the Fn Project CLI\n                is currently using.\n\nUnless you explicitly specify a different version when you re-build the function later,\n            the Fn Project CLI continues to use the FDK version specified by the\n                build_image: and run_image: parameters. \nNote that in the case of Java functions, previous versions of the Fn Project CLI did add\n            the runtime:, build_image:, and\n                run_image: parameters to func.yaml files, to help ensure the\n            function code remained compatible with the Java FDK's build-time and runtime base\n            images.\nIf you want to re-build an existing function with a different language version, and\n            include a different runtime in the function's Docker image, change the values of the\n                build_image: and run_image: parameters in the\n            function's func.yaml file to reference a different version of the language FDK.

It is built on enterprise-grade Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and powered by the Fn Project open source engine. Use OCI Functions (sometimes abbreviated to just Functions, and formerly known as Oracle Functions) when you want to focus on writing code to meet business needs. \nThe serverless and elastic architecture of OCI Functions means there's no infrastructure administration or software administration for you to perform. You don't provision or maintain compute instances, and operating system software patches and upgrades are applied automatically. OCI Functions simply ensures your app is highly-available, scalable, secure, and monitored. With OCI Functions, you can write code in Java, Python, Node, Go, Ruby, and C# (and for advanced use cases, bring\u00c2\u00a0your own Dockerfile, and Graal VM). You can then deploy your code, call it directly or trigger it in response to events, and get billed only for the resources consumed during the execution. \nOCI Functions is based on Fn Project. Fn Project is an open source, container native, serverless platform that can be run anywhere - any cloud or on-premises. Fn Project is easy to use, extensible, and performant. You can download and install the open source distribution of Fn Project, develop and test a function locally, and then use the same tooling to deploy that function to OCI Functions.\nYou can access OCI Functions using the Console, a CLI, and a REST\u00c2\u00a0API. You can invoke the functions you deploy to OCI Functions using the CLI or by making signed HTTP requests.\nOCI Functions is integrated with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Identity and Access Management (IAM), which provides easy authentication with native Oracle Cloud Infrastructure identity functionality. See Overview of Identity and Access Management.\nTo get set up and running quickly with OCI Functions, see the Functions QuickStart Guides. A number of related Developer Tutorials are available, as well as other Samples, Playbooks, Architectures, Tutorials, and Blog Posts.\n Important Advance Notice of Mandatory Requirement to Upgrade the Fn Project CLI, April 2021If you have installed the Fn Project CLI and are using it to initialize, build, and deploy functions, you will have to upgrade the Fn Project CLI on or before 1st May, 2021.

Features in Application Performance Monitoring (APM) enable you to identify and troubleshoot failures and latency issues in the functions you create and deploy.\nIn the Application Performance Monitoring service:\n\nAn APM domain contains the systems monitored by Application Performance Monitoring. An APM domain is an instance of a collector of trace and span data which stores, aggregates, displays, and visualizes the data.\nA trace is the complete flow of a request as it passes through all the components of\n                a distributed system in a given time period. It consists of an entire tree of spans\n                all related to the same single overall request flow.\nA span is an operation or a logical unit of work with a name, start time, and\n                duration, within a trace. A span is a time segment associated with the duration of a\n                unit of work within the overall request flow.\n\nThe Application Performance Monitoring Trace Explorer enables you to visualize the entire request flow and explore trace and span details for diagnostics. You can view and monitor slow traces and traces with errors. To isolate and identify trace issues, you can drill down into specific spans, such as page loads, AJAX calls, and service requests. For more information about the Application Performance Monitoring service, see Application Performance Monitoring.\nTo enable tracing for a function, you must:\n\nSet up a policy to give the OCI Functions service permission to access APM domains, if the policy does not exist already (see Policy Statements to Give the OCI Functions Service and OCI Functions Users Access to Tracing Resources). \nSet up an APM domain.\nEnable tracing for the Functions application and select the APM domain you\n                created.\nEnable tracing for one or more functions.\n\nWhen you enable tracing for a function, OCI Functions automatically generates a \"default function invocation span.\" The default span captures information about the function's execution context including the overall time taken to process the request and return a response to the caller. In addition to the default function invocation span, you can add code to functions to define custom spans. Use custom spans to capture more function-specific information to help with debugging. For example, you might define custom spans to capture the start and end of specific units of work. For example, units of work could include getting the database password from the Vault, opening a database connection, and retrieving records from the database.\nFour variables have been added to the OCI Functions context that provide helpful tracing information. These variables include:\n\nFN_APP_NAME: The function application name.\nFN_FN_NAME: The function name.\nOCI_TRACE_COLLECTOR_URL: The APM domain URL with data key.\nOCI_TRACING_ENABLED: Is tracing enabled?\nWhen retrieved from environment variables, returns 0 or 1.\nWhen retrieved from the function context, returns true or\n                            false as appropriate for the language used.\n\n\n\nRequired IAM Policy for Enabling Tracing\nBefore you can enable tracing, the group to which you belong must have permission to access existing APM domains or to create APM domains. In addition, OCI Functions must have permission to access APM domains. See Policy Statements to Give the OCI Functions Service and OCI Functions Users Access to Tracing Resources.\n\n"

In addition, Docker gives each version of an image a unique alphanumeric digest. When pushing an updated Docker image, it's recommended best practice to give the updated image a new tag to identify it, rather than reusing an existing tag. However, even if you push an updated image and give it the same name and tag as an earlier version, the newly pushed version will have a different digest to the earlier version. \nWhen you create a function with OCI Functions, you specify the name and tag of a particular version of an image on which to base the function. To avoid later inconsistencies, OCI Functions also records the unique digest of that particular version of the image.\nBy default, if you push an updated version of an image  to the Docker registry with the same name and tag as the original version of the image on which a function is based, OCI Functions continues to use the original digest to pull the original version of the image. This might be the behavior you require. However, if you want OCI Functions to pull the later version of the image, you can explicitly change the digest that OCI Functions uses to identify which version of the image to pull in one of the following ways:\n\n\nUse the fn update function command and specify the original name and tag of the version of the image on which you want the function to be based. For example:\nfn update function acmeapp acme-func --image phx.ocir.io/ansh81vru1zp/acme-repo/acme-func:0.0.4 --annotation oracle.com/oci/imageDigest=\\\"\\\" \nOCI Functions will update the digest recorded for the image on which the function is based to be the digest of the image in the Docker registry that has the name and tag you specify.\n\n\nUse the fn update function command and specify the digest of the version of the image on which you want the function to be based.  For example:\nfn update function acmeapp acme-func \u00e2\u0080\u0093-annotation oracle.com/oci/imageDigest='\"sha256:8af7cb8d7______c498c0\"' \nOCI Functions will update the digest recorded for the image on which the function is based to be the digest  you specify. \n\nUse the Console and click Edit Function on the Function Information tab, re-select the original name and tag of the version of the image on which the function is currently based, and click Save Changes.

We recommend you regularly check that the latest version is installed. For more information, see Steps to upgrade the Fn Project CLI.\nThe Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Logging service is the default and\n            recommended option for accessing, searching, and storing function logs.\nAlternatively, you can send function logs to an external logging destination like\n            Papertrail instead by using the Fn Project CLI to\n            specify a syslog URL. Note that to use an external logging destination, you must have\n            set up a VCN with public subnets and an internet gateway (see Creating the VCN and Subnets to Use with OCI Functions, if they don't exist already). \nTo send function logs to an external logging destination by\n            setting the syslog URL:\n\nLog in to your development environment as a functions developer.\n\nTo create a new application and specify that all functions in the application\n                    send their logs to an external logging destination, enter:\nfn create app <app-name> --syslog-url <logging-service-url> --annotation oracle.com/oci/subnetIds='[\"<subnet-ocid>\"]'\nwhere:\n\n<app-name> is the name of the new application. Avoid entering confidential information.\n<logging-service-url> is the syslog URL to which to\n                        send logs.\n<subnet-ocid> is the OCID of the public subnet (or\n                        subnets, up to a maximum of six)\u00c2\u00a0in which to run functions. If a regional\n                        subnet has been defined, best practice is to select that subnet to make\n                        failover across availability domains simpler to implement. If a regional\n                        subnet has not been defined and you need to meet high availability\n                        requirements, select multiple subnets (enclose each OCID in double quotes\n                        separated by commas, in the format\n                            '[\"<subnet-ocid>\",\"<subnet-ocid>\"]'.\n                        Oracle recommends that the public subnets are in the same region as the\n                        Docker registry that's specified in the Fn Project CLI context (see Creating an Fn Project CLI Context to Connect to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure).\n\nFor example:\nfn create app acmeapp --syslog-url tcp://my.papertrail.com:4242 --annotation oracle.com/oci/subnetIds='[\"ocid1.subnet.oc1.phx.aaaaaaaacnh...\"]'\nNote that if you subsequently set up Oracle Cloud Infrastructure\n                    Logging to store logs, the existing syslog URL details are retained. So if you\n                    later decide to resume sending function logs to the external logging\n                    destination, you simply have to disable Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Logging and logs will be sent to the\n                    syslog URL again.\n\n\nTo update an existing application and specify that all functions in the\n                    application send their logs to an external logging destination, enter:\nfn update app <app-name> --syslog-url <logging-service-url> \nwhere:\n\n<app-name> is the name of the application to\n                        update\n<logging-service-url> is the syslog URL to which to\n                        send logs\n\nFor example:\nfn update app acmeapp --syslog-url tcp://my.papertrail.com:4242\n\n\nTo update an existing application and remove the external logging destination\n                    specified for the syslog URL, enter:\nfn update app <app-name> --syslog-url '' \nwhere:\n\n<app-name> is the name of the application to\n                        update\n\nFor example:\nfn update app acmeapp --syslog-url ''\n\n\n"

This storage is persistent from session to session, but after 6-months of non-use, the administrator for your tenancy will receive a notification that the storage will be removed in 60 days. Starting a cloud shell session resets the storage removal timer.\nCloud Shell does not support mounting additional storage.\nCloud Shell does not scan user files for malware or viruses.\nCloud Shell sessions do not allow for any incoming connections, and there is no\n                public IP address available.\nThe OCI CLI will execute commands against the region selected in the Console's Region selection menu when the Cloud Shell was started. Changing the region selection in the console will not change the region for existing Cloud Shell instances; you will need to open a new Cloud Shell instance to change regions.\nCloud Shell sessions have a maximum length of 24 hours, and time out after 60\n                minutes of inactivity.\n\nCloud Shell uses websockets to communicate between your browser and the service.\n                    If your browser has websockets disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has\n                    websockets disabled you will see an error message (\"An unexpected error\n                    occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud Shell from the console.\n\nCloud Shell is designed for interactive use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Users who need additional storage for Cloud Shell or want to run non-interactive long-running tasks are encouraged to use Compute and Storage resources in their tenancy.\nFor maximum compatibility, Cloud Shell includes Python version 2 and Python version\n                3. Python 2 is the default that will run when you enter 'python' at the command\n                line. To run Python 3, enter 'python3' at the command line.\nThe following reserved words can't be used as the user name for a Cloud Shell user: oci, root, bin, daemon, adm, lp, sync, shutdown, halt, mai, operator, games, ftp, nobody, oci, systemd-network, dbus, polkitd, tss, and apache. Attempting to create a Cloud Shell session when logged in with a user name (or the part of the name before the @ sign if the user name is an email address)\u00c2\u00a0that is one of these reserved words will result in an \"Unexpected Error\" message.\nEntirely numerical user names (for example, \"1234\")\u00c2\u00a0are not supported by Cloud Shell.\nThe Cloud Shell session time zone is UTC, and cannot be changed.\nCloud Shell does not allow root access or the use of sudo, so packages that require\n                root access for installation can't be installed. Many packages are available in\n                versions that do not require root for installation; you can unpack and install these\n                in your home directory. \nCloud Shell does not allow the use of ping, since ping requires root access.\nCloud Shell boots in FIPS mode, which might affect the behavior of some commands.\nCloud Shell cannot generate PKCS#1 keys when using the openssl command, because Cloud Shell boots in FIPS mode. FIPS mode requires that Cloud Shell generates PKCS#8 keys.\nFor more information on Cloud Shell limits, see the Cloud Shell section in Service Limits. \n\nCloud Shell Access and Other Restrictions\nYou can access OCI resources from Cloud Shell according to the policies granted by\n                your tenancy administrator.

Note Cloud Shell uses websockets to\n                    communicate between your browser and the service. If your browser has websockets\n                    disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has websockets disabled you will see an\n                    error message (\"An unexpected error occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud\n                    Shell from the console.\nWhile Cloud Shell provides access to the internet, there is no ingress from the\n                outside world into Cloud Shell (for example: you cannot ssh in to Cloud Shell) and\n                no public IP address available.

The customer's OCI usage allows them to\n      earn rewards that they can apply to pay the Oracle database enterprise support contract\n      invoice. These invoices are paid in a separate Billing Center system outside of OCI. As a result, Oracle Support Rewards can help lower your\n      support bill.\nOracle Support Rewards are tied to your\n      subscription, if your subscription is enrolled. Support rewards are accrued at the rate\n      specified in your universal credits order document, and can be redeemed against support\n      invoices for eligible products.\nOracle Support Rewards also integrates\n      with Organization\n        Management. Namely: \n\nBoth parent and standalone tenancies can see their rewards.\nParent tenancies can view their own rewards, plus their child tenancy rewards.\nChild tenancies cannot see their rewards. Child tenancies viewing the Oracle\n          Support Rewards page only see a message indicating that they are logged into a\n        child tenancy, since Oracle Support Rewards are only visible from the parent tenancy. \n\nUsing the Oracle Support Rewards page, an OCI administrator can view what rewards have\n      accrued, and they can also drill into what specific usage earned them their rewards.\nAlso see the following instructional videos about Oracle Support Rewards:\n\nOverview: Summary of the end-to-end process (3:44)\nAdministration: How to view and share available rewards in the Console (3:16)\nRedemption: How to redeem rewards in the Billing Center (7:07)\n\n"

The customer's OCI usage allows them to\n      earn rewards that they can apply to pay the Oracle database enterprise support contract\n      invoice. These invoices are paid in a separate Billing Center system outside of OCI. As a result, Oracle Support Rewards can help lower your\n      support bill.\nOracle Support Rewards are tied to your\n      subscription, if your subscription is enrolled. Support rewards are accrued at the rate\n      specified in your universal credits order document, and can be redeemed against support\n      invoices for eligible products.\nOracle Support Rewards also integrates\n      with Organization\n        Management. Namely: \n\nBoth parent and standalone tenancies can see their rewards.\nParent tenancies can view their own rewards, plus their child tenancy rewards.\nChild tenancies cannot see their rewards. Child tenancies viewing the Oracle\n          Support Rewards page only see a message indicating that they are logged into a\n        child tenancy, since Oracle Support Rewards are only visible from the parent tenancy. \n\nUsing the Oracle Support Rewards page, an OCI administrator can view what rewards have\n      accrued, and they can also drill into what specific usage earned them their rewards.\nAlso see the following instructional videos about Oracle Support Rewards:\n\nOverview: Summary of the end-to-end process (3:44)\nAdministration: How to view and share available rewards in the Console (3:16)\nRedemption: How to redeem rewards in the Billing Center (7:07)\n\n"

The customer's OCI usage allows them to\n      earn rewards that they can apply to pay the Oracle database enterprise support contract\n      invoice. These invoices are paid in a separate Billing Center system outside of OCI. As a result, Oracle Support Rewards can help lower your\n      support bill.\nOracle Support Rewards are tied to your\n      subscription, if your subscription is enrolled. Support rewards are accrued at the rate\n      specified in your universal credits order document, and can be redeemed against support\n      invoices for eligible products.\nOracle Support Rewards also integrates\n      with Organization\n        Management. Namely: \n\nBoth parent and standalone tenancies can see their rewards.\nParent tenancies can view their own rewards, plus their child tenancy rewards.\nChild tenancies cannot see their rewards. Child tenancies viewing the Oracle\n          Support Rewards page only see a message indicating that they are logged into a\n        child tenancy, since Oracle Support Rewards are only visible from the parent tenancy. \n\nUsing the Oracle Support Rewards page, an OCI administrator can view what rewards have\n      accrued, and they can also drill into what specific usage earned them their rewards.\nAlso see the following instructional videos about Oracle Support Rewards:\n\nOverview: Summary of the end-to-end process (3:44)\nAdministration: How to view and share available rewards in the Console (3:16)\nRedemption: How to redeem rewards in the Billing Center (7:07)\n\n"

If your browser has websockets\n                    disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has websockets disabled you will see an\n                    error message (\"An unexpected error occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud\n                    Shell from the console.\nWhile Cloud Shell provides access to the internet, there is no ingress from the\n                outside world into Cloud Shell (for example: you cannot ssh in to Cloud Shell) and\n                no public IP address available. If your tenancy admin does not want to enable access\n                to the internet from OCI, they should not grant access to Cloud Shell with an IAM\n                policy.\n\n"

For more\n                    information, see VCN Cross-Region Peering.  Note A subnet chosen for a Cloudshell Private Network\n                            must have at least one non-reserved IP address for the subnet's CIDR\n                            block available.

This storage is persistent from session to session, but after 6-months of non-use, the administrator for your tenancy will receive a notification that the storage will be removed in 60 days. Starting a cloud shell session resets the storage removal timer.\nCloud Shell does not support mounting additional storage.\nCloud Shell does not scan user files for malware or viruses.\nCloud Shell sessions do not allow for any incoming connections, and there is no\n                public IP address available.\nThe OCI CLI will execute commands against the region selected in the Console's Region selection menu when the Cloud Shell was started. Changing the region selection in the console will not change the region for existing Cloud Shell instances; you will need to open a new Cloud Shell instance to change regions.\nCloud Shell sessions have a maximum length of 24 hours, and time out after 60\n                minutes of inactivity.\n\nCloud Shell uses websockets to communicate between your browser and the service.\n                    If your browser has websockets disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has\n                    websockets disabled you will see an error message (\"An unexpected error\n                    occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud Shell from the console.\n\nCloud Shell is designed for interactive use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Users who need additional storage for Cloud Shell or want to run non-interactive long-running tasks are encouraged to use Compute and Storage resources in their tenancy.\nFor maximum compatibility, Cloud Shell includes Python version 2 and Python version\n                3. Python 2 is the default that will run when you enter 'python' at the command\n                line. To run Python 3, enter 'python3' at the command line.\nThe following reserved words can't be used as the user name for a Cloud Shell user: oci, root, bin, daemon, adm, lp, sync, shutdown, halt, mai, operator, games, ftp, nobody, oci, systemd-network, dbus, polkitd, tss, and apache. Attempting to create a Cloud Shell session when logged in with a user name (or the part of the name before the @ sign if the user name is an email address)\u00c2\u00a0that is one of these reserved words will result in an \"Unexpected Error\" message.\nEntirely numerical user names (for example, \"1234\")\u00c2\u00a0are not supported by Cloud Shell.\nThe Cloud Shell session time zone is UTC, and cannot be changed.\nCloud Shell does not allow root access or the use of sudo, so packages that require\n                root access for installation can't be installed. Many packages are available in\n                versions that do not require root for installation; you can unpack and install these\n                in your home directory. \nCloud Shell does not allow the use of ping, since ping requires root access.\nCloud Shell boots in FIPS mode, which might affect the behavior of some commands.\nCloud Shell cannot generate PKCS#1 keys when using the openssl command, because Cloud Shell boots in FIPS mode. FIPS mode requires that Cloud Shell generates PKCS#8 keys.\nFor more information on Cloud Shell limits, see the Cloud Shell section in Service Limits. \n\nCloud Shell Access and Other Restrictions\nYou can access OCI resources from Cloud Shell according to the policies granted by\n                your tenancy administrator. There is no additional access because you're using Cloud\n                Shell, and Cloud Shell does not provide any additional access to your tenancy, or\n                private resources in your tenancy VCNs. Note Cloud Shell uses websockets to\n                    communicate between your browser and the service. If your browser has websockets\n                    disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has websockets disabled you will see an\n                    error message (\"An unexpected error occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud\n                    Shell from the console.\nWhile Cloud Shell provides access to the internet, there is no ingress from the\n                outside world into Cloud Shell (for example: you cannot ssh in to Cloud Shell) and\n                no public IP address available.

The resource is at risk of becoming inoperable, as indicated by metric values. \nNon-optimal. The resource is performing at non-optimal levels, as indicated by metric values. \nResource is up or down. The resource is either not reachable or not operating. \n\nThe following examples use the CpuUtilization metric emitted by the oci_computeagent metric namespace. This metric monitors the utilization of the compute instance and the activity level of any services and applications running on the instance. CpuUtilization is a key performance metric for a cloud service because it indicates CPU usage for the compute instance and it can be used to investigate performance issues. To learn more about CPU\u00c2\u00a0usage, see the following URL:\u00c2\u00a0https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_time.\nAt-Risk Example\nA typical at-risk threshold for the CpuUtilization metric is any value greater than 80 percent. A compute instance breaching this threshold is at risk of becoming inoperable. Often the cause of this behavior is one or more applications consuming a high percentage of the CPU. \nIn this example, you decide to notify the operations team immediately, setting the severity of the alarm as \u00e2\u0080\u009cCritical\u00e2\u0080\u009d because repair is required to bring the instances back to optimal operational levels. You configure alarm notifications to the responsible team by both PagerDuty and email, requesting an investigation and appropriate fixes before the instances go into an inoperable state. You set repeat notifications every minute. When someone responds to the alarm notifications, you temporarily stop notifications using the best practice of suppressing the alarm\u00c2\u00a0. Once metrics return to optimal values, you remove the suppression. \n\nNon-Optimal Example\nA\u00c2\u00a0typical non-optimal threshold for the CpuUtilization metric is from 60 to 80 percent. When the metric\u00c2\u00a0 values for a compute instance are within this range, the instance is above the optimal operational range. \nIn this example, you decide to notify the appropriate individual or team that an application or process is consuming more CPU than usual. You configure a threshold alarm to notify the appropriate contacts, setting the severity of the alarm as \u00e2\u0080\u009cWarning,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as no immediate actions are required to investigate and reduce the CPU. You set notification to email only, directed to the appropriate developer or team, with repeat notifications every 24 hours to reduce email notification noise. \n\nResource is Up or Down Example\nA typical indicator of resource availability is a five-minute absence of the CpuUtilization metric. A compute instance breaching this threshold is either not reachable or not operating. The resource may have stopped responding, or it might have become unavailable because of connectivity issues.\nIn this example, you decide to notify the operations team immediately, setting the severity of your absence alarm as \u00e2\u0080\u009cCritical\u00e2\u0080\u009d because repair is required to bring the instances online. You configure alarm notifications to the responsible team by both PagerDuty and email, requesting an investigation and a move of the workloads to another available resource. You set repeat notifications every minute. When someone responds to the alarm notifications, you temporarily stop notifications using the best practice of suppressing the alarm.

        "text": "oracle cloud infrastructure, oci, Best Practices for Your Alarms service, \n Create a Set of Alarms for Each Metric, \nFor each metric emitted by your resources, create alarms that define the following resource behaviors: \n\nAt risk. The resource is at risk of becoming inoperable, as indicated by metric values. \nNon-optimal. The resource is performing at non-optimal levels, as indicated by metric values. \nResource is up or down. The resource is either not reachable or not operating. \n\nThe following examples use the CpuUtilization metric emitted by the oci_computeagent metric namespace. This metric monitors the utilization of the compute instance and the activity level of any services and applications running on the instance. CpuUtilization is a key performance metric for a cloud service because it indicates CPU usage for the compute instance and it can be used to investigate performance issues. To learn more about CPU\u00c2\u00a0usage, see the following URL:\u00c2\u00a0https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_time.\nAt-Risk Example\nA typical at-risk threshold for the CpuUtilization metric is any value greater than 80 percent. A compute instance breaching this threshold is at risk of becoming inoperable. Often the cause of this behavior is one or more applications consuming a high percentage of the CPU. \nIn this example, you decide to notify the operations team immediately, setting the severity of the alarm as \u00e2\u0080\u009cCritical\u00e2\u0080\u009d because repair is required to bring the instances back to optimal operational levels. You configure alarm notifications to the responsible team by both PagerDuty and email, requesting an investigation and appropriate fixes before the instances go into an inoperable state. You set repeat notifications every minute. When someone responds to the alarm notifications, you temporarily stop notifications using the best practice of suppressing the alarm\u00c2\u00a0. Once metrics return to optimal values, you remove the suppression. \n\nNon-Optimal Example\nA\u00c2\u00a0typical non-optimal threshold for the CpuUtilization metric is from 60 to 80 percent. When the metric\u00c2\u00a0 values for a compute instance are within this range, the instance is above the optimal operational range. \nIn this example, you decide to notify the appropriate individual or team that an application or process is consuming more CPU than usual. You configure a threshold alarm to notify the appropriate contacts, setting the severity of the alarm as \u00e2\u0080\u009cWarning,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as no immediate actions are required to investigate and reduce the CPU. You set notification to email only, directed to the appropriate developer or team, with repeat notifications every 24 hours to reduce email notification noise. \n\nResource is Up or Down Example\nA typical indicator of resource availability is a five-minute absence of the CpuUtilization metric. A compute instance breaching this threshold is either not reachable or not operating. The resource may have stopped responding, or it might have become unavailable because of connectivity issues.\nIn this example, you decide to notify the operations team immediately, setting the severity of your absence alarm as \u00e2\u0080\u009cCritical\u00e2\u0080\u009d because repair is required to bring the instances online. You configure alarm notifications to the responsible team by both PagerDuty and email, requesting an investigation and a move of the workloads to another available resource. You set repeat notifications every minute. When someone responds to the alarm notifications, you temporarily stop notifications using the best practice of suppressing the alarm. When the CpuUtilization metric is once again detected from the resource, you remove the suppression.\n\n"

Events (the messages, not the service) follow the CloudEvents industry standard format hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). This standard allows for interoperability between various cloud providers or on-premises systems and cloud providers. An event could be a create, read, update, or delete (CRUD) operation, a resource lifecycle state change, or a system event impacting a resource. For example, an event can be emitted when a backup completes or fails, or a file in an Object Storage bucket is added, updated, or deleted. \nServices emit events for resources or data. For example, Object Storage emits events for buckets and objects. Services emit different types of events for resources, which are distinguished as event types. Buckets and objects have event types of create, update, and delete, for example. Event types are the changes that produce events by a given resource. For a list of services that produce events and the event types that those services track, see Services that Produce Events. \n  You work with events by creating rules. Rules include a filter you define to specify events produced by the resources in your tenancy. The filter is flexible: \n\nYou can define filters that match only certain events or all events. \nYou can define filters based on the way resources are tagged or the presence of specific values in attributes from the event itself. \n\nRules must also specify an action to trigger when the filter finds a matching event. Actions are responses you define for event matches. You set up select Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services that the Events service has established as actions (more on these select services follows). The resources for these services act as destinations for matching events. When the filter in the rule finds a match, the Events service delivers the matching event to one or more of the destinations you identified in the rule. The destination service that receives the event then processes the event in whatever manner you defined. This delivery provides the automation in your environment. \nYou can only deliver events to certain Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services with a rule.

This storage is persistent from session to session, but after 6-months of non-use, the administrator for your tenancy will receive a notification that the storage will be removed in 60 days. Starting a cloud shell session resets the storage removal timer.\nCloud Shell does not support mounting additional storage.\nCloud Shell does not scan user files for malware or viruses.\nCloud Shell sessions do not allow for any incoming connections, and there is no\n                public IP address available.\nThe OCI CLI will execute commands against the region selected in the Console's Region selection menu when the Cloud Shell was started. Changing the region selection in the console will not change the region for existing Cloud Shell instances; you will need to open a new Cloud Shell instance to change regions.\nCloud Shell sessions have a maximum length of 24 hours, and time out after 60\n                minutes of inactivity.\n\nCloud Shell uses websockets to communicate between your browser and the service.\n                    If your browser has websockets disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has\n                    websockets disabled you will see an error message (\"An unexpected error\n                    occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud Shell from the console.\n\nCloud Shell is designed for interactive use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Users who need additional storage for Cloud Shell or want to run non-interactive long-running tasks are encouraged to use Compute and Storage resources in their tenancy.\nFor maximum compatibility, Cloud Shell includes Python version 2 and Python version\n                3. Python 2 is the default that will run when you enter 'python' at the command\n                line. To run Python 3, enter 'python3' at the command line.\nThe following reserved words can't be used as the user name for a Cloud Shell user: oci, root, bin, daemon, adm, lp, sync, shutdown, halt, mai, operator, games, ftp, nobody, oci, systemd-network, dbus, polkitd, tss, and apache. Attempting to create a Cloud Shell session when logged in with a user name (or the part of the name before the @ sign if the user name is an email address)\u00c2\u00a0that is one of these reserved words will result in an \"Unexpected Error\" message.\nEntirely numerical user names (for example, \"1234\")\u00c2\u00a0are not supported by Cloud Shell.\nThe Cloud Shell session time zone is UTC, and cannot be changed.\nCloud Shell does not allow root access or the use of sudo, so packages that require\n                root access for installation can't be installed. Many packages are available in\n                versions that do not require root for installation; you can unpack and install these\n                in your home directory. \nCloud Shell does not allow the use of ping, since ping requires root access.\nCloud Shell boots in FIPS mode, which might affect the behavior of some commands.\nCloud Shell cannot generate PKCS#1 keys when using the openssl command, because Cloud Shell boots in FIPS mode. FIPS mode requires that Cloud Shell generates PKCS#8 keys.\nFor more information on Cloud Shell limits, see the Cloud Shell section in Service Limits. \n\nCloud Shell Access and Other Restrictions\nYou can access OCI resources from Cloud Shell according to the policies granted by\n                your tenancy administrator. There is no additional access because you're using Cloud\n                Shell, and Cloud Shell does not provide any additional access to your tenancy, or\n                private resources in your tenancy VCNs. Note Cloud Shell uses websockets to\n                    communicate between your browser and the service. If your browser has websockets\n                    disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has websockets disabled you will see an\n                    error message (\"An unexpected error occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud\n                    Shell from the console.\nWhile Cloud Shell provides access to the internet, there is no ingress from the\n                outside world into Cloud Shell (for example: you cannot ssh in to Cloud Shell) and\n                no public IP address available.

For\n                    example, you might set up a Notifications topic\n                    and create subscriptions for the DevOps team so that they are notified when\n                    backups complete.

The resources you specify for actions do not have to be in the same\n                    compartment as the rule. \nPlan filtering\nEnsure the resources that you want to monitor emit events to the Events service and plan your pattern matching\n                    strategy.

        "text": "oracle cloud infrastructure, oci, Cloud Shell service, \n Cloud Shell Limitations, \nKeep the following limitations in mind when using Cloud Shell:\n\nCloud Shell comes with 5GB\u00c2\u00a0of storage for the VM's home directory. This storage is persistent from session to session, but after 6-months of non-use, the administrator for your tenancy will receive a notification that the storage will be removed in 60 days. Starting a cloud shell session resets the storage removal timer.\nCloud Shell does not support mounting additional storage.\nCloud Shell does not scan user files for malware or viruses.\nCloud Shell sessions do not allow for any incoming connections, and there is no\n                public IP address available.\nThe OCI CLI will execute commands against the region selected in the Console's Region selection menu when the Cloud Shell was started. Changing the region selection in the console will not change the region for existing Cloud Shell instances; you will need to open a new Cloud Shell instance to change regions.\nCloud Shell sessions have a maximum length of 24 hours, and time out after 60\n                minutes of inactivity.\n\nCloud Shell uses websockets to communicate between your browser and the service.\n                    If your browser has websockets disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has\n                    websockets disabled you will see an error message (\"An unexpected error\n                    occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud Shell from the console.\n\nCloud Shell is designed for interactive use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Users who need additional storage for Cloud Shell or want to run non-interactive long-running tasks are encouraged to use Compute and Storage resources in their tenancy.\nFor maximum compatibility, Cloud Shell includes Python version 2 and Python version\n                3. Python 2 is the default that will run when you enter 'python' at the command\n                line. To run Python 3, enter 'python3' at the command line.\nThe following reserved words can't be used as the user name for a Cloud Shell user: oci, root, bin, daemon, adm, lp, sync, shutdown, halt, mai, operator, games, ftp, nobody, oci, systemd-network, dbus, polkitd, tss, and apache. Attempting to create a Cloud Shell session when logged in with a user name (or the part of the name before the @ sign if the user name is an email address)\u00c2\u00a0that is one of these reserved words will result in an \"Unexpected Error\" message.\nEntirely numerical user names (for example, \"1234\")\u00c2\u00a0are not supported by Cloud Shell.\nThe Cloud Shell session time zone is UTC, and cannot be changed.\nCloud Shell does not allow root access or the use of sudo, so packages that require\n                root access for installation can't be installed. Many packages are available in\n                versions that do not require root for installation; you can unpack and install these\n                in your home directory. \nCloud Shell does not allow the use of ping, since ping requires root access.\nCloud Shell boots in FIPS mode, which might affect the behavior of some commands.\nCloud Shell cannot generate PKCS#1 keys when using the openssl command, because Cloud Shell boots in FIPS mode. FIPS mode requires that Cloud Shell generates PKCS#8 keys.\nFor more information on Cloud Shell limits, see the Cloud Shell section in Service Limits. \n\nCloud Shell Access and Other Restrictions\nYou can access OCI resources from Cloud Shell according to the policies granted by\n                your tenancy administrator. There is no additional access because you're using Cloud\n                Shell, and Cloud Shell does not provide any additional access to your tenancy, or\n                private resources in your tenancy VCNs. Note Cloud Shell uses websockets to\n                    communicate between your browser and the service. If your browser has websockets\n                    disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has websockets disabled you will see an\n                    error message (\"An unexpected error occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud\n                    Shell from the console.\nWhile Cloud Shell provides access to the internet, there is no ingress from the\n                outside world into Cloud Shell (for example: you cannot ssh in to Cloud Shell) and\n                no public IP address available. If your tenancy admin does not want to enable access\n                to the internet from OCI, they should not grant access to Cloud Shell with an IAM\n                policy.\n\n"

        "text": "oracle cloud infrastructure, oci, Cloud Shell service, \n Cloud Shell Limitations, \nKeep the following limitations in mind when using Cloud Shell:\n\nCloud Shell comes with 5GB\u00c2\u00a0of storage for the VM's home directory. This storage is persistent from session to session, but after 6-months of non-use, the administrator for your tenancy will receive a notification that the storage will be removed in 60 days. Starting a cloud shell session resets the storage removal timer.\nCloud Shell does not support mounting additional storage.\nCloud Shell does not scan user files for malware or viruses.\nCloud Shell sessions do not allow for any incoming connections, and there is no\n                public IP address available.\nThe OCI CLI will execute commands against the region selected in the Console's Region selection menu when the Cloud Shell was started. Changing the region selection in the console will not change the region for existing Cloud Shell instances; you will need to open a new Cloud Shell instance to change regions.\nCloud Shell sessions have a maximum length of 24 hours, and time out after 60\n                minutes of inactivity.\n\nCloud Shell uses websockets to communicate between your browser and the service.\n                    If your browser has websockets disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has\n                    websockets disabled you will see an error message (\"An unexpected error\n                    occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud Shell from the console.\n\nCloud Shell is designed for interactive use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Users who need additional storage for Cloud Shell or want to run non-interactive long-running tasks are encouraged to use Compute and Storage resources in their tenancy.\nFor maximum compatibility, Cloud Shell includes Python version 2 and Python version\n                3. Python 2 is the default that will run when you enter 'python' at the command\n                line. To run Python 3, enter 'python3' at the command line.\nThe following reserved words can't be used as the user name for a Cloud Shell user: oci, root, bin, daemon, adm, lp, sync, shutdown, halt, mai, operator, games, ftp, nobody, oci, systemd-network, dbus, polkitd, tss, and apache. Attempting to create a Cloud Shell session when logged in with a user name (or the part of the name before the @ sign if the user name is an email address)\u00c2\u00a0that is one of these reserved words will result in an \"Unexpected Error\" message.\nEntirely numerical user names (for example, \"1234\")\u00c2\u00a0are not supported by Cloud Shell.\nThe Cloud Shell session time zone is UTC, and cannot be changed.\nCloud Shell does not allow root access or the use of sudo, so packages that require\n                root access for installation can't be installed. Many packages are available in\n                versions that do not require root for installation; you can unpack and install these\n                in your home directory. \nCloud Shell does not allow the use of ping, since ping requires root access.\nCloud Shell boots in FIPS mode, which might affect the behavior of some commands.\nCloud Shell cannot generate PKCS#1 keys when using the openssl command, because Cloud Shell boots in FIPS mode. FIPS mode requires that Cloud Shell generates PKCS#8 keys.\nFor more information on Cloud Shell limits, see the Cloud Shell section in Service Limits. \n\nCloud Shell Access and Other Restrictions\nYou can access OCI resources from Cloud Shell according to the policies granted by\n                your tenancy administrator. There is no additional access because you're using Cloud\n                Shell, and Cloud Shell does not provide any additional access to your tenancy, or\n                private resources in your tenancy VCNs. Note Cloud Shell uses websockets to\n                    communicate between your browser and the service. If your browser has websockets\n                    disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has websockets disabled you will see an\n                    error message (\"An unexpected error occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud\n                    Shell from the console.\nWhile Cloud Shell provides access to the internet, there is no ingress from the\n                outside world into Cloud Shell (for example: you cannot ssh in to Cloud Shell) and\n                no public IP address available. If your tenancy admin does not want to enable access\n                to the internet from OCI, they should not grant access to Cloud Shell with an IAM\n                policy.\n\n"

        "text": "oracle cloud infrastructure, oci, Logging Overview service, \n How Logging Works, \nUse Logging to enable, manage, and search logs. The three kinds of logs are the following:\n\nAudit logs: Logs related to events emitted by the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Audit service. These logs are available from the Logging Audit page, or are searchable on the Search page alongside the rest of your logs.\nService logs: Emitted by OCI native services, such as API Gateway, Events, Functions, Load Balancer, Object Storage, and VCN Flow Logs. Each of these supported services has pre-defined logging categories that you can enable or disable on your respective resources.\nCustom logs: Logs that contain diagnostic information from custom applications, other cloud providers, or an on-premises environment. Custom logs can be ingested through the API, or by configuring the Unified Monitoring Agent. You can configure an OCI compute instance/resource to directly upload Custom Logs through the Unified Monitoring Agent. Custom logs are supported in both a virtual machine and bare metal scenario.\n\nA log is a first-class Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resource that stores and captures log events collected in a given context. For example, if you enable Flow Logs on a subnet, it has its own dedicated log. Each log has an OCID and is stored in a log group. A log group is a collection of logs stored in a compartment. Logs and log groups are searchable, actionable, and transportable.\nTo get started, enable a log for a resource. Services provide log categories for the different types of logs available for resources. For example, the Object Storage service supports the following log categories for storage buckets: read and write access events. Read access events capture download events, while write access events capture write events. Each service can have different log categories for resources. The log categories for one service have no relationship to the log categories of another service. As a result, the Functions service uses different log categories than the Object Storage service. \nWhen you enable a log, you must add it to a log group that you create. Log groups are logical containers for logs. Use log groups to organize and streamline management of logs by applying IAM policy or grouping logs for analysis. For more information, see Managing Logs and Log Groups.\nLogs are indexed in the system, and searchable through the Console, API, and CLI. You can view and search logs on the Logging Search page. When searching logs, you can correlate across many logs simultaneously. For example, you can view results from multiple logs, multiple log groups, or even an entire compartment with one query. You can filter, aggregate, and visualize your logs. For more information, see Searching Logs. \n Note Only UTF-8 text encoding is supported.\nAfter you enable a log, log entries begin to appear on the detail page for the log (see Enabling Logging for a Resource for more information).\n Note You can view usage report detail for Logging by accessing Cost and Usage Reports.\nService Connector Hub Integration\nOracle Cloud Infrastructure Logging integrates with Service Connector Hub. If you need more archiving support, you can use Service Connector Hub for archiving to object storage, writing to stream, and so on. For more information, see Scenario: Archiving Logs to Object Storage.\n\nLogging Workshop\nSee the OCI Logging Workshop for step-by-step, lab-based instructions on setting up your environment, enabling service logs, creating custom application logs, searching logs, and exporting log content to Object Storage.\n\nLogging APIs\nOracle Cloud Infrastructure Logging has the following APIs available:\n\nLogging Management API\nLogging Ingestion API\nLogging Search API\n\nAlso see Using the (Logging Management) API, Using the (Logging Ingestion) API for custom logs, and Using the (Logging Search) API for more information on logging operations specific to each API.\n\n"

See Supported Services.\nCustom Logs\nDiagnostic information from custom applications, other cloud providers, or an\n                    on-premise environment. To ingest custom logs, call the API directly or\n                    configure the unified monitoring agent.\nAudit Logs\nRead-only logs from the Audit service, provided for you to analyze and search.\n                    Audit logs capture the information about API calls made to public endpoints\n                    throughout your tenancy. These include API calls made by the Console, Command Line Interface (CLI), Software\n                    Development Kits (SDK), your own custom clients, or other Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services. \nLog Groups\nLog groups are logical containers for logs. Use log groups to streamline log\n                    management, including applying IAM policy or searching sets of logs. You can\n                    move log groups from one compartment to another and all the logs contained in\n                    the log group moves with it. \nService Log Category\nServices provide log categories for the different types of logs available for\n                    resources. For example, the Object Storage\n                    service supports the following log categories for storage buckets: read and\n                    write access events. Read access events capture download events, while write\n                    access events capture write events. Each service can have different log\n                    categories for resources. The log categories for one service have no\n                    relationship to the log categories of another service.\nService Connector Hub\n\nService Connector Hub moves logging data to other services in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. For example, use Service\n                        Connector Hub to alarm on log data, send log data to\n                            databases, and archive log data to\n                            Object Storage.

    {
        "text": "oracle cloud infrastructure, oci, Logging Overview service, \n How Logging Works, \nUse Logging to enable, manage, and search logs. The three kinds of logs are the following:\n\nAudit logs: Logs related to events emitted by the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Audit service. These logs are available from the Logging Audit page, or are searchable on the Search page alongside the rest of your logs.\nService logs: Emitted by OCI native services, such as API Gateway, Events, Functions, Load Balancer, Object Storage, and VCN Flow Logs. Each of these supported services has pre-defined logging categories that you can enable or disable on your respective resources.\nCustom logs: Logs that contain diagnostic information from custom applications, other cloud providers, or an on-premises environment. Custom logs can be ingested through the API, or by configuring the Unified Monitoring Agent. You can configure an OCI compute instance/resource to directly upload Custom Logs through the Unified Monitoring Agent. Custom logs are supported in both a virtual machine and bare metal scenario.\n\nA log is a first-class Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resource that stores and captures log events collected in a given context. For example, if you enable Flow Logs on a subnet, it has its own dedicated log. Each log has an OCID and is stored in a log group. A log group is a collection of logs stored in a compartment. Logs and log groups are searchable, actionable, and transportable.\nTo get started, enable a log for a resource. Services provide log categories for the different types of logs available for resources. For example, the Object Storage service supports the following log categories for storage buckets: read and write access events. Read access events capture download events, while write access events capture write events. Each service can have different log categories for resources. The log categories for one service have no relationship to the log categories of another service. As a result, the Functions service uses different log categories than the Object Storage service. \nWhen you enable a log, you must add it to a log group that you create. Log groups are logical containers for logs. Use log groups to organize and streamline management of logs by applying IAM policy or grouping logs for analysis. For more information, see Managing Logs and Log Groups.\nLogs are indexed in the system, and searchable through the Console, API, and CLI. You can view and search logs on the Logging Search page. When searching logs, you can correlate across many logs simultaneously. For example, you can view results from multiple logs, multiple log groups, or even an entire compartment with one query. You can filter, aggregate, and visualize your logs. For more information, see Searching Logs. \n Note Only UTF-8 text encoding is supported.\nAfter you enable a log, log entries begin to appear on the detail page for the log (see Enabling Logging for a Resource for more information).\n Note You can view usage report detail for Logging by accessing Cost and Usage Reports.\nService Connector Hub Integration\nOracle Cloud Infrastructure Logging integrates with Service Connector Hub. If you need more archiving support, you can use Service Connector Hub for archiving to object storage, writing to stream, and so on. For more information, see Scenario: Archiving Logs to Object Storage.\n\nLogging Workshop\nSee the OCI Logging Workshop for step-by-step, lab-based instructions on setting up your environment, enabling service logs, creating custom application logs, searching logs, and exporting log content to Object Storage.\n\nLogging APIs\nOracle Cloud Infrastructure Logging has the following APIs available:\n\nLogging Management API\nLogging Ingestion API\nLogging Search API\n\nAlso see Using the (Logging Management) API, Using the (Logging Ingestion) API for custom logs, and Using the (Logging Search) API for more information on logging operations specific to each API.\n\n"

You can\n                    move log groups from one compartment to another and all the logs contained in\n                    the log group moves with it. \nService Log Category\nServices provide log categories for the different types of logs available for\n                    resources. For example, the Object Storage\n                    service supports the following log categories for storage buckets: read and\n                    write access events. Read access events capture download events, while write\n                    access events capture write events. Each service can have different log\n                    categories for resources. The log categories for one service have no\n                    relationship to the log categories of another service.\nService Connector Hub\n\nService Connector Hub moves logging data to other services in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. For example, use Service\n                        Connector Hub to alarm on log data, send log data to\n                            databases, and archive log data to\n                            Object Storage.

The overall process first\n            involves creating a compartment, then placing all the instances in the compartment you\n            want to collect logs from. Next, you can create the Dynamic Group. The Dynamic Group\n            policy statement would then point to the compartment that contains the instances.\n            Lastly, create a log group, custom log, and its associated agent configuration.\nSet the following policy\n            statement:allow dynamic-group <dynamic_group_name> to use log-content in tenancy\nThis policy statement allows the agent configuration to push logs to the Logging service\n            backend, which you can later see in the Logging Service's Search\n            page.\nIn the Dynamic Groups configuration, set up your Dynamic Group to have a rule that\n            includes all the agents that you want to use to send logs to the Logging service. For\n            example, in a Rule inside the Dynamic Group it can state:\nANY {instance.id = 'ocid1.instance.<region>.<location>.<unique_ID>', \ninstance.compartment.id = 'ocid1.compartment.<region>..<unique_ID>'}\nIf you remove instance.id =\n                    'ocid1.instance.<region>.<location>.<unique_ID>'\n            and just\n            have:ANY {instance.compartment.id = 'ocid1.compartment.<region>..<unique_ID>'}\n            this means use all the instances under this compartment to send logs. For more\n            information on Dynamic Groups, see About Dynamic Groups.\nNext, create the log group (see To create a log group). After the log group is created, you can then create the custom log and the agent\n            configuration (see Creating Custom Logs for steps to create the\n            custom log and agent configuration).

This storage is persistent from session to session, but after 6-months of non-use, the administrator for your tenancy will receive a notification that the storage will be removed in 60 days. Starting a cloud shell session resets the storage removal timer.\nCloud Shell does not support mounting additional storage.\nCloud Shell does not scan user files for malware or viruses.\nCloud Shell sessions do not allow for any incoming connections, and there is no\n                public IP address available.\nThe OCI CLI will execute commands against the region selected in the Console's Region selection menu when the Cloud Shell was started. Changing the region selection in the console will not change the region for existing Cloud Shell instances; you will need to open a new Cloud Shell instance to change regions.\nCloud Shell sessions have a maximum length of 24 hours, and time out after 60\n                minutes of inactivity.\n\nCloud Shell uses websockets to communicate between your browser and the service.\n                    If your browser has websockets disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has\n                    websockets disabled you will see an error message (\"An unexpected error\n                    occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud Shell from the console.\n\nCloud Shell is designed for interactive use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Users who need additional storage for Cloud Shell or want to run non-interactive long-running tasks are encouraged to use Compute and Storage resources in their tenancy.\nFor maximum compatibility, Cloud Shell includes Python version 2 and Python version\n                3. Python 2 is the default that will run when you enter 'python' at the command\n                line. To run Python 3, enter 'python3' at the command line.\nThe following reserved words can't be used as the user name for a Cloud Shell user: oci, root, bin, daemon, adm, lp, sync, shutdown, halt, mai, operator, games, ftp, nobody, oci, systemd-network, dbus, polkitd, tss, and apache. Attempting to create a Cloud Shell session when logged in with a user name (or the part of the name before the @ sign if the user name is an email address)\u00c2\u00a0that is one of these reserved words will result in an \"Unexpected Error\" message.\nEntirely numerical user names (for example, \"1234\")\u00c2\u00a0are not supported by Cloud Shell.\nThe Cloud Shell session time zone is UTC, and cannot be changed.\nCloud Shell does not allow root access or the use of sudo, so packages that require\n                root access for installation can't be installed. Many packages are available in\n                versions that do not require root for installation; you can unpack and install these\n                in your home directory. \nCloud Shell does not allow the use of ping, since ping requires root access.\nCloud Shell boots in FIPS mode, which might affect the behavior of some commands.\nCloud Shell cannot generate PKCS#1 keys when using the openssl command, because Cloud Shell boots in FIPS mode. FIPS mode requires that Cloud Shell generates PKCS#8 keys.\nFor more information on Cloud Shell limits, see the Cloud Shell section in Service Limits. \n\nCloud Shell Access and Other Restrictions\nYou can access OCI resources from Cloud Shell according to the policies granted by\n                your tenancy administrator. There is no additional access because you're using Cloud\n                Shell, and Cloud Shell does not provide any additional access to your tenancy, or\n                private resources in your tenancy VCNs. Note Cloud Shell uses websockets to\n                    communicate between your browser and the service. If your browser has websockets\n                    disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has websockets disabled you will see an\n                    error message (\"An unexpected error occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud\n                    Shell from the console.\nWhile Cloud Shell provides access to the internet, there is no ingress from the\n                outside world into Cloud Shell (for example: you cannot ssh in to Cloud Shell) and\n                no public IP address available.
