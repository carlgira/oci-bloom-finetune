        "text": "oracle cloud infrastructure, oci, Cloud Shell service, \n Cloud Shell Limitations, \nKeep the following limitations in mind when using Cloud Shell:\n\nCloud Shell comes with 5GB\u00c2\u00a0of storage for the VM's home directory. This storage is persistent from session to session, but after 6-months of non-use, the administrator for your tenancy will receive a notification that the storage will be removed in 60 days. Starting a cloud shell session resets the storage removal timer.\nCloud Shell does not support mounting additional storage.\nCloud Shell does not scan user files for malware or viruses.\nCloud Shell sessions do not allow for any incoming connections, and there is no\n                public IP address available.\nThe OCI CLI will execute commands against the region selected in the Console's Region selection menu when the Cloud Shell was started. Changing the region selection in the console will not change the region for existing Cloud Shell instances; you will need to open a new Cloud Shell instance to change regions.\nCloud Shell sessions have a maximum length of 24 hours, and time out after 60\n                minutes of inactivity.\n\nCloud Shell uses websockets to communicate between your browser and the service.\n                    If your browser has websockets disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has\n                    websockets disabled you will see an error message (\"An unexpected error\n                    occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud Shell from the console.\n\nCloud Shell is designed for interactive use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Users who need additional storage for Cloud Shell or want to run non-interactive long-running tasks are encouraged to use Compute and Storage resources in their tenancy.\nFor maximum compatibility, Cloud Shell includes Python version 2 and Python version\n                3. Python 2 is the default that will run when you enter 'python' at the command\n                line. To run Python 3, enter 'python3' at the command line.\nThe following reserved words can't be used as the user name for a Cloud Shell user: oci, root, bin, daemon, adm, lp, sync, shutdown, halt, mai, operator, games, ftp, nobody, oci, systemd-network, dbus, polkitd, tss, and apache. Attempting to create a Cloud Shell session when logged in with a user name (or the part of the name before the @ sign if the user name is an email address)\u00c2\u00a0that is one of these reserved words will result in an \"Unexpected Error\" message.\nEntirely numerical user names (for example, \"1234\")\u00c2\u00a0are not supported by Cloud Shell.\nThe Cloud Shell session time zone is UTC, and cannot be changed.\nCloud Shell does not allow root access or the use of sudo, so packages that require\n                root access for installation can't be installed. Many packages are available in\n                versions that do not require root for installation; you can unpack and install these\n                in your home directory. \nCloud Shell does not allow the use of ping, since ping requires root access.\nCloud Shell boots in FIPS mode, which might affect the behavior of some commands.\nCloud Shell cannot generate PKCS#1 keys when using the openssl command, because Cloud Shell boots in FIPS mode. FIPS mode requires that Cloud Shell generates PKCS#8 keys.\nFor more information on Cloud Shell limits, see the Cloud Shell section in Service Limits. \n\nCloud Shell Access and Other Restrictions\nYou can access OCI resources from Cloud Shell according to the policies granted by\n                your tenancy administrator. There is no additional access because you're using Cloud\n                Shell, and Cloud Shell does not provide any additional access to your tenancy, or\n                private resources in your tenancy VCNs. Note Cloud Shell uses websockets to\n                    communicate between your browser and the service. If your browser has websockets\n                    disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has websockets disabled you will see an\n                    error message (\"An unexpected error occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud\n                    Shell from the console.\nWhile Cloud Shell provides access to the internet, there is no ingress from the\n                outside world into Cloud Shell (for example: you cannot ssh in to Cloud Shell) and\n                no public IP address available. If your tenancy admin does not want to enable access\n                to the internet from OCI, they should not grant access to Cloud Shell with an IAM\n                policy.\n\n"

An API gateway presents a server certificate to an API client during a TLS handshake, enabling the API client to validate the authenticity of the API gateway. The process of the API client authenticating the API gateway is known as one-way TLS.\nIn many situations, you only want to allow authenticated API clients to access an API. In these situations, you want the API gateway to validate the authenticity of an API client, by verifying the TLS certificate presented by the API client. The process of the API gateway authenticating the API client is known as mutual TLS (mTLS).\nWith mTLS, both the API gateway and the API client exchange and verify certificates during the TLS handshake. The API gateway verifies the TLS certificate presented by the API client using custom Certificate Authority (CA) root certificates, and custom CA bundles of root and intermediate certificates. The custom CAs and CA bundles are stored in the API gateway's trust store, along with a default CA bundle that contains certificates of well-known public CAs. Note that in an mTLS handshake, the API gateway only uses custom CAs and custom CA bundles to verify API client certificates. The API gateway does not use the default CA bundle to verify API client certificates. So if you want an API gateway to support mTLS, you must add custom CAs and CA bundles to the API gateway's trust store (see Customizing Trust Stores for TLS Certificate Verification).\nFor extra control, you can also specify that certificates presented by API clients to an API gateway must contain particular values in the certificate's Email  Address, URL, or Domain Name fields. If you specify values for these fields when setting up mTLS for an API gateway, the API gateway will reject requests from API clients presenting certificates that do not contain them. If you don't specify values for these fields when setting up mTLS, the API gateway will accept all requests from API clients providing the certificate is valid. You can specify up to 10 values for each API deployment.\nAfter a successful mTLS handshake between the API gateway and an API client, a Base64-encoded version of the certificate presented by the API client is saved in the request.cert context table as a context variable named request.cert[client_base64]. When defining an API deployment, you can reference the certificate using the format ${request.cert[client_base64]} (see Adding Context Variables to Policies and HTTP Back End Definitions). Note that if an API client presents a TLS certificate that is greater than 8 KB in size (after it has been Base64-encoded), the certificate is not saved as a context variable.\nYou use a request policy in the API deployment specification to add mTLS support to an API  (see Adding Request Policies and Response Policies to API Deployment Specifications). The mTLS request policy applies globally to all routes in an API deployment specification.\nNote the following:\nIf an API client presents a TLS certificate to an API gateway and the API deployment is not mTLS-enabled, the API gateway simply ignores the TLS certificate that has been presented. The request.cert[client_base64] context variable is not set in this situation.\nIf an API gateway is unable to validate the TLS certificate presented by an API client, the API gateway rejects the request with an HTTP 401 error status response code.\nIf an API gateway uses a custom CA bundle to validate the TLS certificate presented by an API client, no more than three CA certificates can be traversed at any point in the certificate chain during validation. In other words, to be valid, a CA certificate in the chain must either itself be signed directly by a custom CA present in the API gateway's trust store, or be no more than two intermediate certificates away from a certificate that has been signed by such a custom CA. Contact us if you want to allow more intermediate certificates.\n\nYou can add an mTLS request policy to an API deployment specification by:\n\nusing the Console\nediting a JSON\u00c2\u00a0file\n\n"

        "text": "oracle cloud infrastructure, oci, Function Development Kits (FDKs) service, \n Behavior in Earlier Versions of the Fn Project CLI (prior to version 0.6.7), \nUsing versions of the Fn Project CLI prior to version 0.6.7, every time you built or\n            rebuilt a function written in a language supported by an FDK (with the exception of\n            Java, see below), the Fn Project CLI used cached versions of the language FDK's\n            build-time and runtime base images, if these were available. If cached versions of the\n            base images were not available, the Fn Project CLI pulled the most recent versions of\n            the base images from Docker Hub. As a result, you could not be certain that the function\n            code was compatible with the language FDK's build-time base image used to build the\n            function executable, or with the runtime base image used to provide the runtime\n            environment.\nYou can continue to build existing functions exactly as before, by not explicitly\n            specifying the version of the language FDK when you build a function. The Fn Project CLI\n            will continue to use cached versions of the FDK's build-time and runtime base images (if\n            available), or pull the most recent versions of the base images from Docker Hub (if\n            cached images are not available). \nStarting with Fn Project CLI version 0.6.7:\n\nIf you explicitly specify the version of the language FDK when you create a\n                function, the Fn Project CLI adds that version as the value of the\n                    build_image: and run_image: parameters in the\n                function's func.yaml file.\nIf you build or deploy a function and the function's func.yaml file does not already\n                contain build_image: and run_image: parameters\n                because it was created with an earlier Fn Project CLI version, the Fn Project CLI\n                adds the parameters to the func.yaml file. The values of the\n                    build_image: and run_image: parameters record\n                the versions of the FDK build-time and runtime base images that the Fn Project CLI\n                is currently using.\n\nUnless you explicitly specify a different version when you re-build the function later,\n            the Fn Project CLI continues to use the FDK version specified by the\n                build_image: and run_image: parameters. \nNote that in the case of Java functions, previous versions of the Fn Project CLI did add\n            the runtime:, build_image:, and\n                run_image: parameters to func.yaml files, to help ensure the\n            function code remained compatible with the Java FDK's build-time and runtime base\n            images.\nIf you want to re-build an existing function with a different language version, and\n            include a different runtime in the function's Docker image, change the values of the\n                build_image: and run_image: parameters in the\n            function's func.yaml file to reference a different version of the language FDK. For\n            consistency and to avoid confusion, update the value of the runtime:\n            parameter to correspond to the --runtime command option for the version\n            of the language FDK. In the case of Java functions, you also have to change the FDK\n            version in the function's pom.xml file. \n"

However,\n            often with modern cloud applications, you need to chain function invocations. OCI\n            Functions tracing provides the ability trace the execution of a function invoked by\n            another function. This ability means you can examine the execution of each function in a\n            chain of calls in a single tree of spans in APM trace explorer.\nTo trace a chain of functions, you need to propagate the X-B3 headers X-B3-TraceId, X-B3-SpanId, X-B3-ParentSpanId, and X-B3-Sampled in the function invocation request from your function code.\nAfter the function has run, the trace data from your functions is collected and available\n            in APM Trace Explorer.

This storage is persistent from session to session, but after 6-months of non-use, the administrator for your tenancy will receive a notification that the storage will be removed in 60 days. Starting a cloud shell session resets the storage removal timer.\nCloud Shell does not support mounting additional storage.\nCloud Shell does not scan user files for malware or viruses.\nCloud Shell sessions do not allow for any incoming connections, and there is no\n                public IP address available.\nThe OCI CLI will execute commands against the region selected in the Console's Region selection menu when the Cloud Shell was started. Changing the region selection in the console will not change the region for existing Cloud Shell instances; you will need to open a new Cloud Shell instance to change regions.\nCloud Shell sessions have a maximum length of 24 hours, and time out after 60\n                minutes of inactivity.\n\nCloud Shell uses websockets to communicate between your browser and the service.\n                    If your browser has websockets disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has\n                    websockets disabled you will see an error message (\"An unexpected error\n                    occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud Shell from the console.\n\nCloud Shell is designed for interactive use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Users who need additional storage for Cloud Shell or want to run non-interactive long-running tasks are encouraged to use Compute and Storage resources in their tenancy.\nFor maximum compatibility, Cloud Shell includes Python version 2 and Python version\n                3. Python 2 is the default that will run when you enter 'python' at the command\n                line. To run Python 3, enter 'python3' at the command line.\nThe following reserved words can't be used as the user name for a Cloud Shell user: oci, root, bin, daemon, adm, lp, sync, shutdown, halt, mai, operator, games, ftp, nobody, oci, systemd-network, dbus, polkitd, tss, and apache. Attempting to create a Cloud Shell session when logged in with a user name (or the part of the name before the @ sign if the user name is an email address)\u00c2\u00a0that is one of these reserved words will result in an \"Unexpected Error\" message.\nEntirely numerical user names (for example, \"1234\")\u00c2\u00a0are not supported by Cloud Shell.\nThe Cloud Shell session time zone is UTC, and cannot be changed.\nCloud Shell does not allow root access or the use of sudo, so packages that require\n                root access for installation can't be installed. Many packages are available in\n                versions that do not require root for installation; you can unpack and install these\n                in your home directory. \nCloud Shell does not allow the use of ping, since ping requires root access.\nCloud Shell boots in FIPS mode, which might affect the behavior of some commands.\nCloud Shell cannot generate PKCS#1 keys when using the openssl command, because Cloud Shell boots in FIPS mode. FIPS mode requires that Cloud Shell generates PKCS#8 keys.\nFor more information on Cloud Shell limits, see the Cloud Shell section in Service Limits. \n\nCloud Shell Access and Other Restrictions\nYou can access OCI resources from Cloud Shell according to the policies granted by\n                your tenancy administrator. There is no additional access because you're using Cloud\n                Shell, and Cloud Shell does not provide any additional access to your tenancy, or\n                private resources in your tenancy VCNs. Note Cloud Shell uses websockets to\n                    communicate between your browser and the service. If your browser has websockets\n                    disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has websockets disabled you will see an\n                    error message (\"An unexpected error occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud\n                    Shell from the console.\nWhile Cloud Shell provides access to the internet, there is no ingress from the\n                outside world into Cloud Shell (for example: you cannot ssh in to Cloud Shell) and\n                no public IP address available. If your tenancy admin does not want to enable access\n                to the internet from OCI, they should not grant access to Cloud Shell with an IAM\n                policy.\n\n"

        "text": "oracle cloud infrastructure, oci, Cloud Shell service, \n Cloud Shell Limitations, \nKeep the following limitations in mind when using Cloud Shell:\n\nCloud Shell comes with 5GB\u00c2\u00a0of storage for the VM's home directory. This storage is persistent from session to session, but after 6-months of non-use, the administrator for your tenancy will receive a notification that the storage will be removed in 60 days. Starting a cloud shell session resets the storage removal timer.\nCloud Shell does not support mounting additional storage.\nCloud Shell does not scan user files for malware or viruses.\nCloud Shell sessions do not allow for any incoming connections, and there is no\n                public IP address available.\nThe OCI CLI will execute commands against the region selected in the Console's Region selection menu when the Cloud Shell was started. Changing the region selection in the console will not change the region for existing Cloud Shell instances; you will need to open a new Cloud Shell instance to change regions.\nCloud Shell sessions have a maximum length of 24 hours, and time out after 60\n                minutes of inactivity.\n\nCloud Shell uses websockets to communicate between your browser and the service.\n                    If your browser has websockets disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has\n                    websockets disabled you will see an error message (\"An unexpected error\n                    occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud Shell from the console.\n\nCloud Shell is designed for interactive use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Users who need additional storage for Cloud Shell or want to run non-interactive long-running tasks are encouraged to use Compute and Storage resources in their tenancy.\nFor maximum compatibility, Cloud Shell includes Python version 2 and Python version\n                3. Python 2 is the default that will run when you enter 'python' at the command\n                line. To run Python 3, enter 'python3' at the command line.\nThe following reserved words can't be used as the user name for a Cloud Shell user: oci, root, bin, daemon, adm, lp, sync, shutdown, halt, mai, operator, games, ftp, nobody, oci, systemd-network, dbus, polkitd, tss, and apache. Attempting to create a Cloud Shell session when logged in with a user name (or the part of the name before the @ sign if the user name is an email address)\u00c2\u00a0that is one of these reserved words will result in an \"Unexpected Error\" message.\nEntirely numerical user names (for example, \"1234\")\u00c2\u00a0are not supported by Cloud Shell.\nThe Cloud Shell session time zone is UTC, and cannot be changed.\nCloud Shell does not allow root access or the use of sudo, so packages that require\n                root access for installation can't be installed. Many packages are available in\n                versions that do not require root for installation; you can unpack and install these\n                in your home directory. \nCloud Shell does not allow the use of ping, since ping requires root access.\nCloud Shell boots in FIPS mode, which might affect the behavior of some commands.\nCloud Shell cannot generate PKCS#1 keys when using the openssl command, because Cloud Shell boots in FIPS mode. FIPS mode requires that Cloud Shell generates PKCS#8 keys.\nFor more information on Cloud Shell limits, see the Cloud Shell section in Service Limits. \n\nCloud Shell Access and Other Restrictions\nYou can access OCI resources from Cloud Shell according to the policies granted by\n                your tenancy administrator. There is no additional access because you're using Cloud\n                Shell, and Cloud Shell does not provide any additional access to your tenancy, or\n                private resources in your tenancy VCNs. Note Cloud Shell uses websockets to\n                    communicate between your browser and the service. If your browser has websockets\n                    disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has websockets disabled you will see an\n                    error message (\"An unexpected error occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud\n                    Shell from the console.\nWhile Cloud Shell provides access to the internet, there is no ingress from the\n                outside world into Cloud Shell (for example: you cannot ssh in to Cloud Shell) and\n                no public IP address available. If your tenancy admin does not want to enable access\n                to the internet from OCI, they should not grant access to Cloud Shell with an IAM\n                policy.\n\n"

This storage is persistent from session to session, but after 6-months of non-use, the administrator for your tenancy will receive a notification that the storage will be removed in 60 days. Starting a cloud shell session resets the storage removal timer.\nCloud Shell does not support mounting additional storage.\nCloud Shell does not scan user files for malware or viruses.\nCloud Shell sessions do not allow for any incoming connections, and there is no\n                public IP address available.\nThe OCI CLI will execute commands against the region selected in the Console's Region selection menu when the Cloud Shell was started. Changing the region selection in the console will not change the region for existing Cloud Shell instances; you will need to open a new Cloud Shell instance to change regions.\nCloud Shell sessions have a maximum length of 24 hours, and time out after 60\n                minutes of inactivity.\n\nCloud Shell uses websockets to communicate between your browser and the service.\n                    If your browser has websockets disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has\n                    websockets disabled you will see an error message (\"An unexpected error\n                    occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud Shell from the console.\n\nCloud Shell is designed for interactive use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Users who need additional storage for Cloud Shell or want to run non-interactive long-running tasks are encouraged to use Compute and Storage resources in their tenancy.\nFor maximum compatibility, Cloud Shell includes Python version 2 and Python version\n                3. Python 2 is the default that will run when you enter 'python' at the command\n                line.

Attempting to create a Cloud Shell session when logged in with a user name (or the part of the name before the @ sign if the user name is an email address)\u00c2\u00a0that is one of these reserved words will result in an \"Unexpected Error\" message.\nEntirely numerical user names (for example, \"1234\")\u00c2\u00a0are not supported by Cloud Shell.\nThe Cloud Shell session time zone is UTC, and cannot be changed.\nCloud Shell does not allow root access or the use of sudo, so packages that require\n                root access for installation can't be installed. Many packages are available in\n                versions that do not require root for installation; you can unpack and install these\n                in your home directory. \nCloud Shell does not allow the use of ping, since ping requires root access.\nCloud Shell boots in FIPS mode, which might affect the behavior of some commands.\nCloud Shell cannot generate PKCS#1 keys when using the openssl command, because Cloud Shell boots in FIPS mode. FIPS mode requires that Cloud Shell generates PKCS#8 keys.\nFor more information on Cloud Shell limits, see the Cloud Shell section in Service Limits. \n\nCloud Shell Access and Other Restrictions\nYou can access OCI resources from Cloud Shell according to the policies granted by\n                your tenancy administrator.

Note Cloud Shell uses websockets to\n                    communicate between your browser and the service. If your browser has websockets\n                    disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has websockets disabled you will see an\n                    error message (\"An unexpected error occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud\n                    Shell from the console.\nWhile Cloud Shell provides access to the internet, there is no ingress from the\n                outside world into Cloud Shell (for example: you cannot ssh in to Cloud Shell) and\n                no public IP address available.

When you change the shape of an instance, you are billed to the nearest second of usage for each shape that you use. For more information, see Compute Pricing and Resource Billing for Stopped Instances.\nIf the instance has secondary VNICs configured, you might need to reconfigure them after the instance is rebooted. For more information, see Virtual Network Interface Cards (VNICs).\nIf the instance is running when you change the shape, it is rebooted as part of the change shape operation.

To avoid this, shut down the instance using the commands available in the OS before you change the shape.\nWhen you change the shape from one hardware series to a different series, some hardware details such as the network interface name might change.

If the OS fails to boot after you change the shape, then you should change the instance back to the original shape.\nIf you created a regular instance using SR-IOV networking (the default for some regular instances), and want to change the instance to a burstable instance, you must also change the networking type to paravirtualized.\n\n"

For a minimum of 30 days after the announcement of support for a new Kubernetes version, Container Engine for Kubernetes continues to support the fourth, oldest available Kubernetes version. After that time, the older Kubernetes version ceases to be supported.\nWhen creating a new cluster with Container Engine for Kubernetes, Oracle recommends that you use the most recent Kubernetes version that Container Engine for Kubernetes supports. When Oracle announces Container Engine for Kubernetes support for a new Kubernetes version, Oracle recommends you upgrade existing clusters to use that new Kubernetes version as soon as possible.\nRelease Calendar\nContainer Engine for Kubernetes (OKE) supports the following versions of Kubernetes for new clusters:\n\n\nKubernetes Version\nPatch release supported by OKE\nUpstream Release Date\nUpstream End-of-life date\nOKE Release Date\nOKE End-of-life Date\n\n\n\n1.25\n1.25.4\n2022-08-23\n2023-10-27\n2023-01-17\n30 days after 1.28 OKE Release Date (planned)\n\n\n1.24\n1.24.1\n2022-05-03\n2023-09-29\n2022-08-02\n30 days after 1.27 OKE Release Date (planned)\n\n\n1.23\n1.23.4\n2021-12-07\n2023-02-28\n2022-05-18\n30 days after 1.26 OKE Release Date (planned)\n\n\nLegal Disclaimer: The table is intended to outline our general product direction.

Consequently, Container Engine for Kubernetes does not support pod security policies and the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller in clusters running Kubernetes version 1.25 and later.\nIf you require similar functionality, consider using Kubernetes pod security standards and the PodSecurity admission controller instead (along with the Privileged, Baseline, and Restricted policies). By default, Container Engine for Kubernetes enables the PodSecurity admission controller in clusters running Kubernetes version 1.23 and later, in order to support pod security standards. For more information about Kubernetes pod security standards, and the PodSecurity admission controller, see Pod Security Standards in the Kubernetes documentation.\nAlternatively, consider using other alternatives that are being developed in the Kubernetes ecosystem to enforce policies.\nIf you do decide to move from using pod security policies and the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller to using pod security standards and the PodSecurity admission controller, see Migrate from PodSecurityPolicy to the Built-In PodSecurity Admission Controller in the Kubernetes documentation. Note that it is important to complete the migration before creating a new cluster running Kubernetes version 1.25, or before upgrading an existing Kubernetes version 1.24 cluster to run Kubernetes version 1.25. Also note that the Console provides a convenient way to disable the use of the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller in existing Kubernetes clusters created and managed by Container Engine for Kubernetes (see Using the Console to Disable the PodSecurityPolicy Admission Controller).\n\nNotes about Container Engine for Kubernetes Support for Kubernetes Version 1.22\nNote that Kubernetes version 1.22 stopped serving a number of deprecated Kubernetes APIs, including:\n\nWebhook resources\nCustomResourceDefinition\nAPIService\nTokenReview\nSubjectAccessReview resources\nCertificateSigningRequest\nLease\nIngress\nIngressClass\nRBAC resources\nPriorityClass\nStorage resources\n\n For more information about migrating from the deprecated APIs, see the Kubernetes Deprecated API Migration Guide.\n\n"

        "text": "oracle cloud infrastructure, oci, Cloud Shell service, \n Cloud Shell Limitations, \nKeep the following limitations in mind when using Cloud Shell:\n\nCloud Shell comes with 5GB\u00c2\u00a0of storage for the VM's home directory. This storage is persistent from session to session, but after 6-months of non-use, the administrator for your tenancy will receive a notification that the storage will be removed in 60 days. Starting a cloud shell session resets the storage removal timer.\nCloud Shell does not support mounting additional storage.\nCloud Shell does not scan user files for malware or viruses.\nCloud Shell sessions do not allow for any incoming connections, and there is no\n                public IP address available.\nThe OCI CLI will execute commands against the region selected in the Console's Region selection menu when the Cloud Shell was started. Changing the region selection in the console will not change the region for existing Cloud Shell instances; you will need to open a new Cloud Shell instance to change regions.\nCloud Shell sessions have a maximum length of 24 hours, and time out after 60\n                minutes of inactivity.\n\nCloud Shell uses websockets to communicate between your browser and the service.\n                    If your browser has websockets disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has\n                    websockets disabled you will see an error message (\"An unexpected error\n                    occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud Shell from the console.\n\nCloud Shell is designed for interactive use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Users who need additional storage for Cloud Shell or want to run non-interactive long-running tasks are encouraged to use Compute and Storage resources in their tenancy.\nFor maximum compatibility, Cloud Shell includes Python version 2 and Python version\n                3. Python 2 is the default that will run when you enter 'python' at the command\n                line. To run Python 3, enter 'python3' at the command line.\nThe following reserved words can't be used as the user name for a Cloud Shell user: oci, root, bin, daemon, adm, lp, sync, shutdown, halt, mai, operator, games, ftp, nobody, oci, systemd-network, dbus, polkitd, tss, and apache. Attempting to create a Cloud Shell session when logged in with a user name (or the part of the name before the @ sign if the user name is an email address)\u00c2\u00a0that is one of these reserved words will result in an \"Unexpected Error\" message.\nEntirely numerical user names (for example, \"1234\")\u00c2\u00a0are not supported by Cloud Shell.\nThe Cloud Shell session time zone is UTC, and cannot be changed.\nCloud Shell does not allow root access or the use of sudo, so packages that require\n                root access for installation can't be installed. Many packages are available in\n                versions that do not require root for installation; you can unpack and install these\n                in your home directory. \nCloud Shell does not allow the use of ping, since ping requires root access.\nCloud Shell boots in FIPS mode, which might affect the behavior of some commands.\nCloud Shell cannot generate PKCS#1 keys when using the openssl command, because Cloud Shell boots in FIPS mode. FIPS mode requires that Cloud Shell generates PKCS#8 keys.\nFor more information on Cloud Shell limits, see the Cloud Shell section in Service Limits. \n\nCloud Shell Access and Other Restrictions\nYou can access OCI resources from Cloud Shell according to the policies granted by\n                your tenancy administrator. There is no additional access because you're using Cloud\n                Shell, and Cloud Shell does not provide any additional access to your tenancy, or\n                private resources in your tenancy VCNs. Note Cloud Shell uses websockets to\n                    communicate between your browser and the service. If your browser has websockets\n                    disabled or uses a corporate proxy that has websockets disabled you will see an\n                    error message (\"An unexpected error occurred\") when attempting to start Cloud\n                    Shell from the console.\nWhile Cloud Shell provides access to the internet, there is no ingress from the\n                outside world into Cloud Shell (for example: you cannot ssh in to Cloud Shell) and\n                no public IP address available. If your tenancy admin does not want to enable access\n                to the internet from OCI, they should not grant access to Cloud Shell with an IAM\n                policy.\n\n"

Examples of where Private Networking can be useful\n            include using it to SSH into compute instances inside of a private network or managing a\n            private OKE cluster.\n Note A Cloud Shell instance is a private instance, and works like a private instance for the purposes of network setup. Using only an internet gateway will not allow egress to the internet from a private subnet. Using a service gateway or a NAT gateway will. For more information, see the Internet Gateway documentation.\nRequirements and IAM Policy\nTo use Private Networking, you (or an administrator) will need to specify the\n                following policies:\n\n\nallow group <group> to use subnets in compartment <compartment>\n\n\nallow group <group> to use vnics in compartment <compartment>\n\n\nallow group <group> to use network-security-groups in compartment <compartment>\n\n\nallow group <group> to inspect vcns in compartment <compartment>\n\n\nIf you're new to policies, see Getting Started with Policies and Common Policies.\nYou'll also need to create private VCNs and Subnets in the appropriate compartments.\n                For more information, see VCNs and Subnets in\n                the Networking\n                documentation. \n\nGetting Started with Private NetworkingTo\n            change which network your Cloud Shell session is using, use the drop-down Network\n            menu at the top of the Cloud Shell terminal window:From this menu you can select a favorite private network connection.\n                To see more options, you can select the Private Network Definition List item,\n                which will display the Private Network Definition List panel.

For more\n                    information, see VCN Cross-Region Peering.  Note A subnet chosen for a Cloudshell Private Network\n                            must have at least one non-reserved IP address for the subnet's CIDR\n                            block available.

        "text": "oracle cloud infrastructure, oci, Key Concepts service, \n Storage Metrics, \nOracle Pulse provides storage metrics for all your organization's services. Storage usage metrics can be useful in detecting unusual storage consumption, pinpointing the source of each anomaly, and understanding when your storage usage is approaching current entitlement. For example, this can be useful in identifying services that consume a disproportionate amount of storage.\nYour storage entitlement is the amount of storage included within the services contract for the service or set of services that your organization has purchased. This includes a base entitlement, and any additional storage purchased either initially or through additions to the contract. Your organization's entitlement is tracked manually by your Oracle customer management team.\nUsing Oracle Pulse, you can monitor both your organization's storage entitlement and the amount of storage your organization consumes. Storage resources can be located @customer or @partner, termed customer-owned storage. Customer-owned storage includes all storage located in your organization's data centers and those belonging to partner organizations. It also includes any Oracle Exadata and Exalogic servers that your organization owns in Oracle data centers. Oracle-owned storage covers all storage used in Oracle services Data Centers, excluding any servers that your organization owns.\nConsumed storage includes the amount of commercial storage allocated for your organization's services on Oracle-owned storage. Commercial storage usually includes all storage used by applications such as Oracle\u00c2\u00ae E-Business Suite and the tools needed to run those applications. Tools could include Oracle Database storage or Database and application software. Commercial storage excludes mirrored file systems, backups, and other items that are considered non-commercial storage.\nConsumed storage is deducted from your running storage entitlement. The consumed storage value also includes non-commercial storage consumption and usage of your organization's own storage resources. This makes consumed storage an important tool for managing your storage and forecasting future use.\nThe Pulse Dashboard summarizes storage usage against entitlement, and shows any changes in recent storage activity. Significant changes in either measure warrant immediate investigation. For more information, see the  Analyzing Storage section in Checking the Performance of Your Services.\nThe Storage dashboard at Customer and Service Level covers storage usage across all your organization's services and associated environments, allowing you to:\n\n\nanalyze storage usage.

The load balancer can route many incoming requests from multiple clients\n            to the destination backend server through a few (one or multiple) backend\n            connections.\nAfter your load balancer connects a client to a backend server, the connection can be\n            closed because of inactivity. Also, you can configure load balancer listeners to control\n            the maximum idle time allowed during each TCP connection or HTTP request and response\n            pair. Oracle recommends that you do not allow your backend servers to close connections\n            to the load balancer.\nThe following timeout settings affect your load balancer's behavior:\n\n\nKeep-alive setting between the load balancer and the client\n\nThe Load Balancer service\n                        sets the keep-alive value to maintain the connection for 10,000 transactions\n                        or until it has been idle for 65 seconds, whichever limit occurs\n                    first.\n Note\nYou cannot change the value of this setting.\n\n\n\nKeep-alive setting between the load balancer and backend server\n\nThe load balancer closes backend server connections that are idle for more than\n                    300 seconds. See Keep-Alive Settings\n                    for more information.\n\n\nIdle Timeout in Seconds\n\nYou can set the duration of the idle timeout when you create a listener as described in Creating a Load Balancer Listener. This setting applies to the time allowed between two successive receive or two successive send network input/output operations during the HTTP request-response phase. See Idle Timeout Settings for more information.\n\n\n"

Node pools enable you to create pools of machines within a cluster that\n            have different configurations. For example, you might create one pool of nodes in a\n            cluster as virtual machines, and another pool of nodes as bare metal machines. A cluster\n            must have a minimum of one node pool, but a node pool need not contain any worker\n            nodes.\nWorker nodes in a node pool are connected to a worker node subnet in your VCN.\n"
